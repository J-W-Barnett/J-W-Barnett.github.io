<div class="Body">
  <p>Clint's character doesn't actually kill anyone on screen, which is quite odd because you get the general feeling that he should or has done. Typically a Clint character is a gun-slinging American hero, and while Walt does get his gun out, he doesn't actually kill anybody. He resolves his problems and his friends' problems through pacifism. By sacrificing himself. American heroes are typically 'shoot first, ask questions later' and it's rather refreshing for a character to take the moral high ground and still succeed.</p>

  <p>Another fascinating inversion of a Clint character is just how overtly religion takes a role in his life. He is a lapsed Catholic in this film and is quite hostile to the priest, yet by the end of the film he's on the floor in the same position as Christ on the crucifix. If we're honest, Walt is closer to Brian of Nazareth than Jesus of Nazareth, as he is a reluctant messiah, but this film highlights a wonderful hypocrisy in American action heroes. American action likes to press forward a Christian message, yet want to encourage 'an eye for an eye'.
  By dying for the his friends without killing anyone, he's closer to a Christ like figure than say Neo from <em>The Matrix</em> or William Wallace from <em>Braveheart</em>. <em>Gran Torino</em> suggests that a man who has spent two hours referring to immigrant groups in a derogatory fashion and being sceptical towards religion is perhaps closer to the messiah than a lot of American action heroes. This film may have a point if you consider Walt's story as the story of redemption, embracing those he once feared and embracing a religion he once rejected.</p>
