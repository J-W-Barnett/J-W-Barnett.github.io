<div class="Body">

  <p>Is there any other actor who can reach the age of 77 and still make 'get off my lawn' seem threatening? I could watch Clint Eastwood play a Larry David type of figure for the rest of my life and still be rather happy. It's hard not to enjoy a film where you have a man mithering about the world around him, yet still having the capacity to kill you. It has flaws, but sometimes you just go with a movie despite it's flaws.</p>

  <p>Firstly, the film is a little bit careless when handling racial politics, yet I still don't doubt that the film is well intentioned. A deliberate point is made throughout <em>Gran Torino </em>about how pretty much all of the characters are immigrants. Apart from the obvious Asian immigrants, there's an Italian barber and an Irish construction worker. Let's not forget there's a certain irony in Clint's American hero being called Walter Kowalski and complaining about immigrants. However, these characters though are still fundamentally stereotypical. The black characters with more than one line of dialogue are gangsters and potential rapists, the Irishman is somewhat aggressive and the Italian sing the work of Gioachino Rossini. As a consequence there isn't much done to undermine Walt's bigotry because it is still possible for a man of migrant decent to be racist.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, there seems to be an imbalance as to how ethnicity is represented. The white immigrants seem to be of a more honest disposition than their ethnic counterparts. As mentioned the white immigrants consist of a barber and a construction worker. If we consider Walt as an immigrant, we also have a soldier. The Black, Hispanic and part of the Asian community are typically shown to be part of a gang, without properly interrogating how these minority youths may resort to gang culture or acknowledging further the many ethnic minority individuals who contribute positively to society.
  I'm not convinced however that this intentional because the central thrust of the story is a comparison as to how white middle-class Americans treat their family compared to working-class ethnic minority Americans treat theirs. The thesis is 'White America' is a product of aggressive capitalism and focuses on self-sufficiency and 'minority America' has a culture of looking after each other. If both come together, they learn to share values. While somewhat overly simplistic in how it's executed, it's hard not to admire the progressive message at the heart of this film.</p>

  <p>In some senses this central premise is an inversion of the Clint Eastwood we've come to expect. Clint is usually a stoic libertarian American hero. In <em>Gran Torino</em>, Clint still has his short fuse, but it's fundamentally a different type of character than I've ever seen him play. This character is essentially a critique of his previous roles. His prejudices are accentuated and brought to the fore and the character progresses in an unexpected fashion. Check out the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/GranTorino/GranTorinoSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a> for more details. Clint still remains rather likeable despite all of this, simply because you understand his emotions and it's hard not to laugh with him at some of the absurdity he faces.</p>

  <p>I only wish the rest of the acting was up to scratch with Clint's. Weirdly enough, I don't hold the cast responsible for their performances. Clint has hired amateur actors to play key parts and during some of the scenes they perform well. A lot of the time though, the performances just aren't that convincing and Clint is notorious for attempting scenes in as few takes as possible and is notorious for not being an actor's director. I feel that the rest of the cast needed a bit more encouragement and feedback in order to provide more convincing performances. It's very easy to critique amateur actors, but when multiple actors under-perform, one has to look somewhere else than just the cast.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Clint is still very adept in terms of pointing the camera. Clint manages to capture the essence of his character through the camera. It's rather slow and ponderous, reflecting the fact he's in the twilight of his years. The frame is largely empty to emphasise his loneliness. Most importantly of all, he understands character placement. He's very precise about where Walt is in relation to those around him. Very rarely is anyone on the same eye-level as him and when they are, it's someone he usually respects. It's small details like this that make me appreciate this film even more.</p>

  <p>Ultimately it's rather fascinating to watch this film in a post-Drumpf election and post-Brexit world. While I do feel some of the themes are somewhat clumsily handled, the central point of the film could not be more apt. A disgruntled elderly white man feels left behind by society, yet through connection to his migrant neighbours both he and the neighbours learn to share cultural values and become connected. I can't help but look at <em>Gran Torino </em>as being a very rough guide to the problems we must tackle. Even if you don't interpret the film in that particular way, it's still fun watching Squinty Clint play a miserable geriatric, it's charming and funnier than I anticipated. Fully recommended.</p>
