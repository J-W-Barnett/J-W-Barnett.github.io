  <p>This is a lesson in poor marketing. Some mistakes have been corrected to some degree due to the DVD release being re-branded as <em>Live. Die. Repeat</em> but this is never going to compete with the original title <em>All You Need is Kill.</em> Seriously, how can you not want to watch a film with that title? It's so blunt and in your face that I know I would be drawn in by it. This is why it's so baffling as to why you would call this film something as generic and nondescript as <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>.</p>

  <p>Now, I realise that's a strange point to begin with but I want to illustrate just how frustrated I am that I basically missed an enjoyable and original film all because of some terrible marketing. I looked at the trailer, saw the title <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, saw Tom Cruise and thought "Oh, it's another Tom Cruise film, <em>Oblivion</em> part 2." When the reality is, it's just not the case.</p>
  <p>What we have here is a rather enjoyable, soft sci-fi blockbuster. The premise is interesting, the story is simple, it's got some good jokes in there and the acting is pretty stable.</p>

  <p>It's quite enjoyable to see Tom Cruise actually have some character development for once. Going from a coward to a hero instead of just being 'standard Tom Cruise hero named Jack'. Even his cowardly persona fits him, he's not pretending to be ordinary man when he's a coward. He's one of those 'Captain Darling' (of <em>Blackadder</em>) type of cowards, looking for ways to complete administrative fights instead of fight. Even if this wasn't Tom Cruise it would still be kind of refreshing to see an action hero essentially start off as an idiot. There are a few scenes in which he dies for the stupidest (or the most amusing) of reasons. There are too many films these days where the action hero is a badass from the start. Even <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, which I'd argue is the greatest action film for at least a decade, essentially has Max as a heroic figure from the start.</p>

  <p>But before we lose our heads and deem this the greatest cinematic event since <em>Citizen Kane</em>, let's put this into perspective. For starters, the action is rather 'meh'. It's too CGI dominated. I realise this film isn't really about the action, but it would certainly help in the final third if the action felt a bit more believable. Furthermore, the colour palette was just a bit too dark for me. I kind of realise that this is about an alien invasion, but not everything has to look <em>Call of Duty</em>. It's got a bit of silliness to it, it would feel more fun if a brighter colour scheme was used.</p>

  <p>I also had a problem with this <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/EdgeOfTomorrow/EdgeOfTomorrowSpoilers.html">potential spoiler</a>.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the whole time travel stuff doesn't make sense. It's not exactly hardcore sci-fi. But then again, it's a rather flimsy argument to make because it's not really about the science anyway, it's more about how Tom Cruise develops as a character, so I wasn't really distracted by this, but I understand if some people are.</p>

  <p>Just to add some opinions that aren't really criticisms or praise:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>The soundtrack... I don't remember it, could be good, could be bad. Let's assume good, because it didn't distract me.</li>
  	<li>It was shot competently. I wasn't appalled or applauding.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Let's be clear though, while in many ways it carries vibes of generic Hollywood, with its dark colour palette and its competent filming and forgettable soundtrack, it is rather nice to have the mainstays of story telling back in an action film. Character development, humour and a coherent plot have been missing for some time now and this is what I would refer to as 'progress'. To be honest, it's just enjoyable to have a new idea for once. Whether this has affected my judgement is up to you really, but I make no secret about just how bored I am of all of these sequels and reboots.</p>

  <p>I'm not going to shout from the rooftops and proclaim this to be one of the best films ever. It's probably not even in the Top 5 of Tom Cruise movies, but this review is really more of a means to discuss a wider problem with modern cinema. I enjoyed what really should be the norm, because unfortunately, this isn't the norm. This is why I would recommend this film. It's got the foundations of a solid action film and it's at least an original idea.</p>
