<div class="Body">

<p>That Sergio Leone is quite of talented isn’t he? He’s done it again, he’s made a simple, stylish and entertaining western. Pretty much everything I’ve said about it’s predecessor still applies, so it’s going to be quite hard to talk about this film. Easy to follow narrative, shot beautifully, great soundtrack and Clint is Clint. I think I preferred this one overall though; I’ll at least attempt to explain why I preferred it.</p>

<p>For starters, that soundtrack is fantastic! The last soundtrack wasn’t terrible either, but this had a wider range of pieces and the final duel really stands out. I’m pretty sure everyone immediately thinks of the soundtrack in final duel when they think about westerns. The mixture of diagetic and non-diagetic sound in order to craft that piece is quite frankly exquisite. It frustrates me to this day that some self proclaimed film buffs haven’t heard of Ennio Morricone. It’s equally frustrating that he wasn’t appreciated when these films were made as well. My first interaction with his work was the soundtrack for <em>The Thing</em>, I was impressed then and I continue to be impressed. He is the kind of composer who’s work you listen to days later.</p>

<p>The editing and the cinematography continue to stand out, but its craft is even more obvious here. This particular story gives you two protagonists and the story of how their relationship with each other changes. One of them (Lee Van Cleef) has a personal vendetta against the antagonist (Gian Maria Volonté), the other doesn’t (Clint Eatwood). Leone builds these relationships into the way the film is shot, emphasising emotional distance and proximity. Leonne understands that you show audiences information, you don’t tell them. If you need further proof of this, just look at how you learn about the character’s motivation.</p>

<p>Finally the performances are strong. As before, Squint Eastwood carries his aura of intensity. Lee Van Cleef is very good at playing the honourable man out for revenge. This creates an interesting juxtaposition between him and Eastwood; one the young roughhouser out for the money and the other the older moral compass. It creates almost a surrogate mentor for Clint’s character and sees some character development as they both learn to work together. A special mention has to go to Gian Maria Volonté as well, who was complete contrast to his character in his last film it wasn’t as distracting seeing him perform another character despite this being a sequel.</p>

<p>However, the use of the same cast can break your immersion for a bit. It does make you question if it is a narrative sequel or a thematic sequel when really this shouldn’t be on your mind in the film. But it’s not just the cast that is similar; they still haven’t got past the dubbing problem. Granted, this is also a low budget film but there was another kid in the film who’s dubbing doesn’t sync up at all, thus breaking your immersion. If it was a glaring distraction in this film, they should have stopped it from happening in this film.</p>

<p>That’s not to say it doesn’t have it’s own unique problems though. It’s a little bit cliché in it’s narrative and lacks the brevity of the first film. It does feel a little bit stretched in places and that some of the sequences were there to pad it out a bit. Furthermore, not every filming decision was perfect. The sequence when the Colonel is staring at the poster was a bit silly for me. Still it’s slightly unfair to criticise the film for not having the narrative ingenuity of Akira Kuasawa. It’s not as if it’s a terrible narrative either, it’s largely a framework for Clint Eastwood to squint and shoot things, so that’s fine by me.</p>
