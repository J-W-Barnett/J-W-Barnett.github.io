<div class="Body">
    <p>This is a big screen film. I mean that in more ways than one. It’s a big screen film literally because the experience is at its best on the big screen and it’s a big screen film because it just oozes mainstream Hollywood.</p>

    <p>Let’s be clear the effects are fantastic! This was shot extremely well and I only wish I'd seen this in the IMAX. If it’s ever put on the big screen again, I would recommend that you see it. Furthermore, Alfonso Cuarón is a director that understands the importance of sound editing, and if we were to do a study on the importance of sound editing, I would show you this film. It really immerses you in the experience and makes you feel like you’re in space.</p>

    <p>It’s just a shame that this good work is undone by a weakly constructed narrative and the unimaginative casting. This is not a slight on George Clooney or Sandra Bullock, but on whoever cast them. I can’t believe either of these actors are astronauts, Clooney more so than Bullock. When I see suave Nespresso man floating about in space, I can’t take him seriously as a space scientist, especially when he’s cracking out the one liners like a tanned Leslie Neilson. His character becomes progressively unlikeable the more he talks about how attractive he is. I’m surprised he didn’t stop to admire his reflection in the passing space debris. This film would’ve worked so much better if you got a group of barely known actors because it would’ve felt so much more real, although I doubt they would’ve got the budget without the big names.</p>

    <p>The self-love of George 'Sparky the dog' Clooney isn’t particularly his fault. It's more of a scripting problem. It’s hard to sympathise with his character, whose response to the floating corpses of his dead or dying comrades is to be sarcastic and smug. Equally he’s a terrible scientist. When Sandra Bollock is on 2% Oxygen, he engages her in conversation. Surely you want to get her to preserve as much oxygen as she can? I’m no scientist but I at least know that. Furthermore, it’s not just that lack of sense that irritates me about that sequence. That conversation feels like it’s shoehorned in to reveal Miss Congeniality’s motivation. Why wouldn’t Curious George be aware of Bulldog’s backstory? I’m not one to tell people how to improve a movie normally, but that sequence would’ve played better if she revealed her previous ordeal despite him telling her to preserve oxygen. It would show how the trauma has been playing on her mind and it would show that she has abandoned hope, in line with the traumatic events that she has experienced.

    <p>In essence these are the main problems with the story, some basic science being out of line and shoehorned character set pieces. As a general narrative it’s fine and easy to follow and normally I’m not that bothered about inaccurate science. In fact some of it in this film didn’t bother me too much. For example I severely doubt you could get from the Hubble Telescope to the International Space Station on a jetpack, but I understand it’s what the narrative needs really. But that oxygen sequence and another particular sequence annoyed me because it just feels just feels so forced and destroys the realism the film is attempting. I will discuss more about that and the characterisation in the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/Gravity/GravitySpoilers.html">spoiler section</a>.</p>

    <p>I will say that theme came across relatively strongly. Humanity vs Nature. The start of the film displayed how humankind is damaging the environment and how it’s looking to dominate it. The end of the film shows how humanity has risen out of nature. Throughout it are different references to how humanity seeks to tame nature through survival of the fittest and pleading towards the supernatural. I just can’t help but wonder if it was a bit too heavy-handed or a bit obvious. <em>Ex Machina</em> and <em>Moon</em> are two science-fiction films with small casts, yet their themes extended to beyond the immediate scientific themes, touching on themes such as capitalism and feminism.</p>

    <p>Still this isn’t a terrible film, it just lacks the basic narrative rigour you should be expecting from science-fiction or most dramas really. You can spend a lot of money to get the complicated effects sorted, how difficult is it to do the cheapest part of the film? I wouldn’t recommend going out of your way to see this film. If you’re bored on a Sunday night and want a simple story, it’s fine. At 90 minutes it doesn’t drag. Unless it ever appears as a special IMAX or even a normal cinema screening, it’s not really worth the time.</p>
