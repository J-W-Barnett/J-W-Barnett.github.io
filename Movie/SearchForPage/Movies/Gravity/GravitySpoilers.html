    <p>The Fire Extinguisher. If anyone didn't laugh at that sequence I commend you. Again, I'm not the most knowledgeable on scientific accuracy, but even from playing Kerbal Space Program I know that flying through space needs absolute precision. You can’t purport to be making an scientifically accurate film and do something as silly as that. You don't have to be a scientist though to understand human behaviour though. Speaking of which, the daftest moment of characterisation is when Never Mind the Bullocks starts crashing the Chinese escape pod where she talks about her kid and about having a sense of purpose again.
    From a character perspective, it doesn't make any sense, she isn't talking to anyone. Even if you were to allow dramatic licence, it still comes across as patronising. We don’t need to be told what’s happening. The most important rule in film making and storytelling (which many people overlook) is 'show, don't tell'. To be honest, I don’t understand why her child’s death is necessary to the plot other than for us to be forced into sympathising with her. If you have to create backstory to force you to sympathise with the protagonist, you haven't created a strong protagonist.</p>
