<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMgyWT075KY" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">The Movie I Wanted Interstellar To Be</a></h2>
<div class="Body">
  <p><em>Arrival</em> might just be the best cinematic release I’ve seen all year, it’s only true competitor is I, Daniel Blake and to compare the two would be a gross disservice to each film, but both impacted me in a profound and emotional way. I, Daniel Blake tapped into my righteous fury at a neglectful and shameful political system and left me upset and despairing at the current state of the world. <em>Arrival</em> left me with a hope for the future.</p>

  <p><em>Arrival</em> is brilliant beyond it’s initial ideas and premise. A great idea still needs great execution and it’s safe to say that Denis Villeneuve knows how to execute a great idea. I can say with confidence that he’s one of the most talented directors working in Hollywood at the minute. He manages to capture and encourage a deep and powerful performance by Amy Adams. She’s vulnerable, yet forthright. She’s emotional, yet logical. She’s uptight, yet warm. She’s a mother. She’s a proper feminist hero, she is a genuine hero yet doesn’t sacrifice an ounce of her femininity to be the hero of the piece. In the era of comic book movies, it’s nice to see a female lead be represented in such a realistic and heroic light.</p>

  <p>Villeneuve also encourages you to invest in this world more by retaining his keen eye for detail. There are obvious details, such as the use of the gas in the ship to symbolise the inherent lack of clarity in language, and more subtle details. For instance the shape of the Heptapod spaceship is very slightly asymmetrical, leaving the audience with a sense of unease at the unusual sight they see before them. These details help create a sense of believability and help entwine the emotional and scientific aspects of the film together. Interstellar had a problem combining these aspects together and each sequence felt like separate entities. By using the subtlest of details, including the use camera filters, <em>Arrival</em> ensures a consistency in storytelling.</p>

  <p>However, this film is not without fault. From a film-making perspective this movie does suffer from an over-abundance of exposition. I understand that science-fiction is often complicated, but it is rather patronising to audiences to explain every minor detail. One key example of over-exposition is the sequence in which Louise has to explain to Colonel GT Weber (Forest Whitaker) why she’s teaching the Heptapods basic English. It’s fairly clear to me you have to start with the basics in order to understand ‘big’ questions.
  ‘Bigger’ and more existential questions require nuance in language. It’s why we don’t teach five year olds philosophy. Audiences are smart enough to understand the point without it being explained to them. Even on a more minor scale there’s too much exposition. Towards the end there is a line of dialogue delivered by Ian (Jeremy Renner) that doesn’t need the second sentence as we as an audience understand his character motivations clearly from the first sentence. If you see the film, I hope you know which line I’m referring to.</p>

  <p>The other flaw from my perspective is that the film oversimplifies the geopolitical landscape. This film essentially represents the Chinese and the Russians as the main aggressors within international politics and represents the United States as being more level headed. While I have no problems with representing China and Russia as aggressive in terms of their handling of foreign policy, I find it problematic that the US would be considered so much more diplomatic by comparison. This is the same nation that has had disastrous forays in the Middle East in recent times and Vietnam in the past. I would have felt more at ease if Louise was more of an isolated figure.</p>

  <p>These problems are relatively minor though. Science-fiction films tend to lump on too much exposition and Hollywood films very rarely criticises the USA over it’s foreign policy. At it’s heart <em>Arrival</em> is an impressive movie which poses a lot of important questions. This movie’s release could not have been more impeccably timed too! With divisions after Brexit and the rise of Donald Drumpf, I left this movie with hope that humanity can get past it’s communication problems. I urge you if you haven’t seen the movie to see it as soon as possible! If you have, in the spirit of the movie, I encourage you to discuss it with other people! Fully recommended!</p>
