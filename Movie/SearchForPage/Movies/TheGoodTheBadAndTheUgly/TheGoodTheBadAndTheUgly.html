<div class="Body">

  <p>You can't help but wish that the director took his own advice really. Three hours is too long a running time and I'm not sure that there was enough in this narrative to sustain it. To make myself clear, this is not a bad movie. In fact it is a very very good movie. No wait, it's a brilliant movie! This does not take away from the fact that there was a lot of meandering in the story. It may be easy to dismiss my opinion on the grounds that I have a short attention span and I wouldn't mind if you did because I may have a short attention span. However, I can only judge a film to my standards and capabilities, which unfortunately does involve my attention span.</p>

<p>For me long running times are acceptable if you're conveying excessiveness, as is prominent in <em>Goodfellas</em> or if you're trying to convey endless torture, like in <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. I don't feel that the running time in this film conveyed anything and served to undermine the tension that Sergio Leone was building up throughout the film because some sequences went on a bit too long. For instance when Tuco is established as a character, I don't think it was necessary for us to see him commit a crime, get chased, saved, captured and then freed. We only needed to see Eastwood free him and meet him afterwards to establish their relationship. There were a few other sequences that could perhaps have been reduced and still had the same impact, including the introduction of Angel Eyes.</p>

<p>Having said that, this film was undermined as soon as it becomes clear that this is a prequel to the other two films. We know it's a prequel as soon as he finds the iconic poncho for the first time and through the way in which Eastwood behaves throughout the film. As soon as you make a prequel for an action film, you undermine a lot of the action because the fate of the main protagonist is already clear. The final duel is so well done and would be one of the most tense scenes I have seen, were it not for the fact that I already knew how it was going to pan out. I suppose you could say that it is an excuse to explore the character more, because Eastwood was essentially a vessel to tell other people's stories in the previous movies, but what's preventing Eastwood's character from being expanded upon in a sequel? Nothing really.</p>

<p>Still this does allow Eastwood to show his acting chops again. He manages to capture the character's youth rather splendidly, in the way he grows from self interest to become more altruistic in the film. I suppose this is the reason his character is referred to as 'the good' because his character is the only one to move away from the greedy nature of capitalism, while the other two didn't. This does not mean that Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef didn't put in good performances. Wallach understands the humour of the character and therefore appropriately differentiates himself from Van Cleef's character. Van Cleef puts in a sterling performance to convince you that he is a completely different character to his previous role in this trilogy. In a way you just wish you saw a bit more of Van Cleef and a bit less of Wallach, but I suppose it's the mystery of Van Cleef and the abrasiveness of Wallach that helps define their characters.</p>

<p>As I touched upon briefly in the above paragraph, this film is thematically stronger than the previous two films, as it places a further emphasis on the corrupting influence of capitalism and greed. As seen through their brutal methods to acquire the wealth they seek. But the setting of the American Civil War also provides a strong anti-war message, displaying the hypocrisies involved and the effect it can have on a wider scale (such as the poverty of nearby towns). It's a stronger film as a consequence.</p>

<p>Speaking of strength, once again the soundtrack is fantastic! We've come to expect this of Ennio Morricone really, but as with the last film, it's impossible to think about westerns without thinking of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFa1-kciCb4">theme tune</a>. I could continue, but I would merely be repeating everything I have said in previous reviews about this trilogy.</p>

<p>This is true of the direction too, because yet again Leone displays his mastery over cinematography. This couldn't be more obvious than when you examine his focus on the characters instead of the weapons during the duels. It places you in the position of those involved in the fighting as well as conveying the characters' emotions. The duels are more tense as a consequence. Furthermore his use of wide landscape shots display the insignificance these characters have in the wider scheme of the war as well as a means to contrast the repulsive violence against the beauty of nature. I could carry on, but I would just be listing each shot and describing it's brilliance, when the best option is to watch the film.</p>

<p>It is a film that you should watch along with the other two films in this trilogy. I have perhaps discussed my two central problems with this film disproportionately and perhaps more bluntly compared to the positives, but this is because I can't begin to convey the intelligence and the beauty involved in this film. If I did, I would merely be repeating points from the previous two films. This isn't to say that flaws aren't distracting and I personally feel that the film would have benefited from a bit of trimming, just to increase it's impact on me. But this film is brilliant and the running time should not dissuade anyone from seeing it.</p>
