<div class="Body">
  <p>This movie is faultless. When I sit down thinking about how to respond to a film, usually the immediate criticisms (as well as the immediate positives) spring to mind. This time I’m honestly quite stumped. The furthest I got was that title doesn’t make much sense because Pan doesn’t appear in the film. But that’s not the film’s fault, that’s the distributor’s. Perhaps the Captain shouldn’t have been portrayed as being quite so evil? But then again, this is a fairytale. Fairytales aren’t really known for their complex characters. Where else would you find characters that are the pure essence of evil? Having said that, there were moments where the Captain was sympathetic. The sequence where he is dealing with his physical injury as his life falls apart is rather moving.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what I can add to the tidal wave of praise this film has received. The fantasy set design is very much 'in prime Tim Burton'; it's just so stunning to look at. The cinematography is engrossing, the actors are brilliant, the soundtrack beautifully serenades you off into the dreamlike world that Ofelia inhabits and the mixture of CGI and practical effects is so well blended, I had no idea where the real world ended and the computer generated world began. All of these elements combined so well to tell an incredible story.</p>

  <p>Thematically there is so much depth to this film as well. It’s definitely one of those films I will watch again and again because I definitely missed out on everything. The nature of faith is quite prevalent in the film: faith at the bleakest of times; Ofelia’s faith in the Kingdom; the Faun’s faith in Ofelia; the Captain’s faith in Fascism and Mercedes’ faith in the Maquis. So much so you have issues of temptation appearing as well, most strikingly when Ofelia eats the grape. It’s quite easy to discuss the nature of reality and perspective as well, due to Ofelia’s perspective being different to everyone else’s. But the nature of innocence is perhaps the most prevalent theme, helped by the juxtaposition with the Spanish Civil War and the fact a child can lose its innocence when exposed to a war-torn world.</p>

  <p>All this really makes you wonder what Guillermo del Toro could’ve done with <em>The Hobbit</em> really. Instead of having a flabby CGI Goblin King, we could’ve had something as imaginative and wonderfully crafted as the child eating hand monster. It really makes you wonder why on earth Hollywood can’t produce something as original and inspiring as <em>Pan’s Labyrinth</em>.</p>

  <p>Honestly, I could go on further and into more detail about why I loved this film but the film pretty much speaks for itself and I can't do much service explaining it. I haven’t seen a film like this since <em>Bunny and the Bull</em> really. It’s better than <em>Bunny and the Bull</em>, but <em>Bunny and the Bull</em> had a similar tone and whimsical feel. I suppose that’s what Hollywood is lacking really; there just isn’t much whimsy any more. Heartily recommended.</p>
