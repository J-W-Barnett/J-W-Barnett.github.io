<div class="Body">

<p>In terms of the character writing, I'm going to focus on James Bond, his relationship with Madeline Swann and Franz Oberhauser/Blofeld (Christoph Walz). The film has so much going on it needs to have lots of characters to fulfil specific jobs, meaning a lot of characters appear, but have little screen time to have a meaningful impact. Focusing on Bond, Swann and Blofeld means I can talk about the main three.</p>

<p>James Bond in this movie doesn't solve one thing about the situation without blind luck or other people telling him where to go. His impact as a spy is massively reduced to him just being an assassin as a consequence. He doesn't have any intelligence about him as a consequence and is pure muscle. But his lack of intelligence extends to what he fails to do as much as what he actually does. There are occasions where he should have covered his tracks, namely Mr White's (Jesper Christensen) hideout, and occasions where he should've disposed of enemies, namely Mr Hinx (<span class="_Xbe kno-fv">Dave Bautista) </span>after Bond crashed the plane.
There is no reason for Bond not to do these things, yet he doesn't do them, purely because the script needs to have it's big reveal moments. We then have Bond behaving in different ways across the film. He's psychopathic and displays no emotion when his personal property is recovered from Skyfall or when he recognises Franz Oberhauser, yet he is hugely upset when Oberhauser shows Swann footage of an event that Bond had already told her about. So we have an erratic and inconsistent Bond who makes morally questionable decisions.</p>

<p>It's impossible to invest in the romance between Bond and Swann because the relationship is rushed. Madeline Swann turns up halfway through the movie and is very hostile to Bond and quite rightly so. He's endangered her life and acts with the pomposity that he's her saviour. This hostility continues into the next location as he has effectively forced her to learn more about her criminal father. They don't appear to grow any closer. Suddenly as soon as they got on the train, there's a dinner, a fight and a drunken fumble in their cabin. After this we're supposed to accept that these people are in love? If all it takes is a bit of alcohol and lust, we'd see more proposals during Freshers' Week than Valentine's Day. They don't grow towards each other, there's no event that brings them closer together. If anything it's a hostage situation until Bond suddenly tells Swann that he loves her.</p>

<p>Compare Madeline to Tracey in <em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service. </em>As an audience we grow to understand Tracey's position and see her and Bond slowly grow together after helping each other out and spending time together. Having Tracey appear from the very start of the movie allows the characters time to learn about each other and feel like the relationship has grown organically. They aren't forced together by circumstance either which makes the relationship feel genuine. It seems to me that Mendes doesn't understand romance. This is his second Bond film which has featured possible sexual assault and this one begins with what has been described in other areas as 'tentacle pornography'. Romance needs time to breathe and is hard to capture when you've had your romantic lead fail to ask for consent and stand in the middle of a lot of tentacle draped women.</p>

<p>Christoph Waltz is the perfect choice to play Blofeld. Blofeld is one of the most iconic villains of all time and Waltz is the best villain actor of our time. Yet it is impossible to feel threatened by him in <em>Spectre</em>. His motivations are flimsy and he serves no real purpose in the film other than to make people nostalgic for the Bond films in the 1960's. Having Blofeld be Franz Oberhauser ensured that he and Bond were step brothers. Thus reducing Blofeld's motivation to kill Bond and take over the be down to jealousy. I get jealous of my brother at times and we argue, it doesn't mean I want to start funding ISIS. Not to mention the brothers thing is clich√© and unimaginative. It's hard to be convinced that this is a serious world when you're borrowing plot lines from <em>Austin Powers: Goldmember</em>. I'd have preferred a simple philosophical difference, like the Batman and the Joker, we don't need to understand much more than that.</p>

<p>Furthermore having him pretend to be someone else before revealing he's Blofeld makes no sense on any level. From an audience perspective, if you're a Bond fan, you knew it was him because it was made too obvious because of the cat, the use of shadow, the film's title etc. Not to mention the return of the character rights to MGM. If you're not a Bond fan, you don't know who Blofeld is and you don't care as a consequence. Within the film's logic, I'm comfortable with Blofeld creating a new identity, but he didn't need to reveal it to Bond. He might as well have revealed his shoe size for all of it's relevance. From Bond's perspective he's still Oberhauser. I imagine he'd call him Oberhauser or even Franz purely to get under his skin.</p>

<p>I'm not even sure what Blofeld's plan is in the film. He sets a trap for Bond so he can kill him. But to do this, he tries to kill Bond as Bond has the mystery unravelled to him? Surely it would have been easier just to wait for Bond to find him? He may have had control of the spy network by the time Bond finds out what's going on. Or not to kill him and instead capture him? Was the trap just to kill him?</p>

<p>When the time comes to kill Bond, Blofeld develops the Dr Evil problem of not killing people the easy way. After monologuing to Bond about how everything is connected without explaining how and after showing Madeline Swann a video confirming that Bond is trustworthy, he decides to kill him with an adapted dentist chair. Quite why everything needs to be connected is beyond me too other than the fact Marvel and DC are doing it. It just reduces the impact of the previous adventures. When Goldfinger used the laser beam, it could have been a means of interrogating Bond to find out what he knows.
In <em>Spectre</em> Blofeld has no reason to torture Bond other than getting a sadistic pleasure out of it. If Bond must die by Blofeld's hand, why did Blofeld send Mr Hinx after him? As a consequence Blofeld appears to be rather stupid and therefore unthreatening. Especially when he keeps Madeline alive and unrestrained in the same room as Bond being tortured, purely because the writers had written themselves into a corner.</p>

<p>In short we have a hero who isn't likeable, a relationship I don't believe in and a villain who isn't threatening. As a consequence it's hard to feel anything during the course of the movie.</p>
