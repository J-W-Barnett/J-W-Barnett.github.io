<p>There are certain things I am a fan of and there are certain things I become obsessive over. The James Bond film series is most certainly a thing I obsess over to the point where I'm likely to forgive it for crimes that I have punished other movies for. Heck, I'm a guy who loves <em>Moonraker</em>, a movie which jumped the shark so hard it ended up in space! Yet, I refuse to be blind to problematic films, it's ultimately just a question of if I run with it or not. To be blunt, I didn't run with this film. <em>Spectre </em>has problems I couldn't get past and left me with emotions ranging from confusion to frustration.</p>

<p>It may be the case that the biggest problem with this film lies with me in terms of what I expected of the film. I wanted this film to be something very different than what we got and perhaps the hype train I got on board went in the wrong direction and pulled in at the wrong station. Yet what is the logical conclusion of this position? That all movies are good and audiences are responsible? Fact is this movie did not resonate with me in a positive way. I'm the consumer and the movie is the product. The product should please the consumer.</p>

<p>The most glaring issue I had with <em>Spectre</em> is its fluctuating tone. Sam Mendes has no idea what tone he's aiming for. <em>Spectre</em> wants to mix the campiness of the Piers Brosnan and Roger Moore films with the seriousness of the Timothy Dalton and early Daniel Craig films. One minute you'll have a character fearing for their lives and lamenting their own existence, the next you'll have a car chase filled with jokes. It's like combining the Vesper shower sequence in <em>Casino Royale </em>with the Indian Tuk Tuk chase in <em>Octopussy</em>. Those films had their darker moments and their comedic moments but they understood how to move these sequences towards each other instead of lurching from one tone to the other. The result is that you have a confused audience who don't know how to feel at the right moment and the main characters project themselves as psychopaths with no understanding of emotion.</p>

<p>I'm not blind to the fact that Bond is essentially a psychopathic figure, but his best films are the ones with a sense of emotion about them. It's hard to disagree with Film Crit Hulk when he says that the best James Bond movies are the ones that are essentially romance films. There's character progression in <em>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</em>, <em>The Living Daylights</em> and <em>Casino Royale</em> as the psychopathic gun for hire learns to fight for something other than Queen and country. In <em>Spectre</em>, Bond (played by Daniel Craig) is at his most psychopathic.
He got away with a lot in <em>Skyfall</em> because the film was about his relationship with his surrogate mother M and other parts of the franchise you can convince yourself that he is holding up moral causes. But in Spectre, there is very little that's redeemable about Bond's behaviour. He threatens his closest allies, he defies orders, he lies, he causes people to die because of his reckless behaviour and most astonishingly of all, he sexually assaults a widow less than twenty-four hours after her husband has died. It's behaviour I haven't seen from Bond since the Connery movies and it's rather uncomfortable viewing.</p>

<p>At this point I feel obliged to highlight that this is not Daniel Craig's fault. In fact, none of the cast are that bad in this film, but they have nothing to feed off because of a dire script. Bond is a reckless egotist and his actions have caused more problems than solutions. Lea Seydoux's Madeline Swann character arc is so rushed that it's hard to believe Zack Snyder wasn't writing this film. Christoph Waltz's character has very little to do and has no real motivation much like Ralph Fiennes' M. I will discuss this in more detail in the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/Spectre/SpectreSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a>, but it's hard to feel anything towards these characters except for a little contempt.</p>

<p>The script's plot is also extremely muddled. Instead of having a coherent narrative, Spectre seems to just sort of travel to different action set pieces. With James Bond being a spy, you'd expect him to uncover details and maybe reach his own conclusions, but instead he turns up to places without a significant plan until people tell him what to do and where to go or a convenience means the plot can progress. If all it takes is a bit of gentle nagging to be a spy, Marge Simpson would be the greatest spy the world has ever seen. I will provide further examples in the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/Spectre/SpectreSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a>, but it means Bond comes across as an idiot and it becomes hard to invest in a mystery that we as an audience cannot piece together ourselves because it relies on a lot of conveniences and information found off the screen.</p>

<p>The script even struggles thematically. One of the plots is to do with changes in spying, which doesn't make sense in this particular context. Imagine, if you will, that <em>Skyfall</em> was an essay titled 'Is James Bond still relevant in the modern spying world?'. A pertinent question considering this was the 50th Anniversary of the Bond franchise. The film concludes with 'of course he is'. So why does <em>Spectre</em> feel the need to raise the same question? It completely undermines the entire purpose of the last movie. This would be fine if it was adding further detail, but considering <em>Skyfall</em> was only released three years ago, <em>Spectre</em> had very little, if anything, to add.</p>

<p>Not all of the problems with <em>Spectre</em> lie with the script though, some of the direction is problematic. There is not one action sequence I was impressed with during this film as while the cinematography was great, the action feels very undramatic. Typically there is tension in a fight. In the <em>Casino Royale</em>, there are sequences in which Bond's life was in jeopardy or where Vesper's life is in jeopardy so there's some tension to the scene. In order to convey this Bond struggles during the fights. A lot of action sequences in <em>Spectre </em>were just used as a means of displaying how superior Bond is, which completely undermines any dramatic tension as we expect Bond to win. Add forgettable soundtrack to the tensionless action and you've got a problem good scripts cannot resolve.</p>

<p>The question as to whether or not I'd recommend <em>Spectre</em> though is complicated. In reality, this isn't actually the worst Bond film. The cinematography is strong as is the production design and the performances were fine. I maintain the worst thing a movie can be is boring and <em>Spectre</em> certainly isn't boring. <em>Thunderball</em>,<em> For Your Eyes Only </em>and <em>Quantum of Solace </em>are just three films that are duller than<em> Spectre</em>. <em>Spectre</em> on the other hand is the most frustrating and disappointing of the Bond franchise.
To me, it is the definition of wasted potential. If this is your first sample of the James Bond franchise, I don't recommend it in the slightest check out <em>Casino Royale</em> and <em>Moonraker</em> to see the most entertaining entries of the James Bond series. As a fan, I am not offended enough by this film to suggest avoiding it. I'd recommend it to James Bond fans purely on the basis that fans expect different things from the franchise and if you're curious enough, it's worth checking out. I know plenty of people that have enjoyed it purely because of nostalgic reasons. Half a recommendation.</p>
