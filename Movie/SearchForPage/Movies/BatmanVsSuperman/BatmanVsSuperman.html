<div class="Body">

  <p>Ever wondered what a Justice League movie would look like if written by an angst-ridden teen? Worry no more as <em>Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> is out! A mixture of heavy handed themes and moodiness makes this perhaps the dullest superhero movie I have seen in some time. Before I am lambasted, I feel the need to say that I am not against DC and I have nothing against 'darker' superhero stories. The greatest graphic novel I've ever read is <em>Watchmen</em>. My favourite superhero is <em>The Dark Knight</em>. Clearly, superheroes can tackle darker themes. It's all about the execution.</p>

  <p>Zack Synder is a keen eye for visuals, he knows how to make sequences look good. <em>Watchmen</em> has some absolutely beautiful cinematography and colour pallets. In this film, the sequence where Bruce Wayne's parents are killed is visually stunning. This is where Synder's talents end. He doesn't get great performances out of his cast, he doesn't have a strong understand of thematic structure, doesn't understand plot and doesn't understand character motivation. This much was clear in <em>Watchmen</em>, the graphic novel discussed how superheroes are psychopaths and would be a problem for society, yet Zack Snyder felt compelled to make the characters look 'cool', thus undermining the entire purpose of the story. It's even clearer in <em>Batman vs Superman</em>. The man should be a cinematographer and not a director.</p>

  <p>I'll begin with the characters as they're the biggest problem with this movie. At the very minimum you want to care about the heroes on screen. <em>Batman vs Superman</em> fails to achieve this minimum. Superman (Henry Cavill) is a hypocritical monster. He takes issue with Batman being a vigilante crime fighter, despite being a vigilante crime fighter himself. His actions have caused the deaths of thousands of people and he blackmails those that oppose him. Batman (Ben Affleck) is a murdering sociopath in this movie too.
  Both of these characters are miserable and offer no altruistic motivations. Superman is only concerned about Lois in this movie, with the exception of those who worship him as a god (as shown through the most downbeat montage since <em>Up</em>). Batman saves one person in this film and that's partly because of a deal. It seems that Synder believes people will only perform altruistic actions for selfish purposes, its no surprise he wants to make a movie about Ayn Rand's <em>Fountainhead</em>. I'm not a Randian, I struggle to empathise with selfish murderers. When they do eventually fight, it is impossible to feel any sort of emotion because they have no real motivation to fight.</p>

  <p>Beyond our two leads, there are a lot of characters who's motivations make little sense and that's largely down to the weak plot. Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg), the supposed villain, actually has a valid reason to want to kill Superman, namely to protect the earth. When a creepy alien destroys half a city and is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people by his presence on the planet and through his actions, it justifiable from a consequentialist perspective to not want Superman around any more. How he goes about it makes no sense, but that's something for the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/BatmanVsSuperman/BatmanVsSupermanSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a>. As for Lois Lane (Amy Adams), she's utterly redundant in this movie. Her entire plot line has no consequence and exists purely to give her something to do. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is only in the film to be part of the trailer.</p>

  <p>It's no wonder the performances are far below standard when the script serves the characters poorly. Henry Cavill looks dower and aggressive in a way I haven't seen since Hayden Christensen was Anakin Skywalker.Gal Gadot delivers her dialogue with no emotion. Jessie Eisenberg is shockingly bad! He's not helped by the utter diatribe he's expected to say, but his Max Landis impression puts him in the same acting territory as Tommy Wiseau! This does make him one of the most entertaining aspects of the movie though, even if all of his 'Man vs God' nonsense is something ripped out of a pubescent teen's 'edgy' diary.</p>

  <p>Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons are the only cast members who come out of this film relatively positively. A stand alone Batman film featuring these two may be something to look forward too. Affleck understands that Batman is ultimately a detective and performs the role in such a way. The limitation to Affleck's portrayal is the character writing and the violent sociopath he's expected to play. Jeremy Irons as Alfred is also a refreshing source of humour in this bleak film. While he is ultimately a pessimist, his wry sarcastic eye allows us as an audience to feel relieved during moments of little tension. It allows us to feel like there's at least one human character in the movie. Given a new director and a new writer, I'd like to see these two in a stand alone movie.</p>

  <p>Beyond the sheer lack of likeable characters, the plot is completely nonsensical. Sub-plots have no consequences. There is no reason for the lead characters to fight other than the script demands it. The fight itself ends in the most absurd fashion. There are many scenes that exist purely to establish the next set of movies. The themes are handled with the subtlety of a <em>Mr Men</em> book read through a megaphone. I could rant for forever and a day about this, and I may well do in the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/BatmanVsSuperman/BatmanVsSupermanSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a>, but the plot is frustratingly incomprehensible. It could have been funny if it wasn't for the tone of the film.</p>

  <p><em>Batman vs Superman</em> has such a tiring and borderline offensive tone. Everything is dark, from the lighting, the colour scheme and topics of conversation. In a fantasy superhero movie it becomes hard to relate to anything. Perfectly fine if you're reading something as intelligent or morally complex as <em>Watchmen</em> or <em>V for Vendetta</em>, but this film has the pseudo-intelligence you expect from an inebriated fresher at University. No Mr Luthor, the oldest lie in America isn't that 'Power can be innocent'.
  If you bothered to read the constitution, you'd realise the USA was founded on the principles that power can never be innocent. Every frivolous detail point Snyder wants to make is said in the dialogue and is not represented through actions. It feels like a lecture. When <em>Dawn of Justice </em>eventually decides it wants to lighten the mood, it does so in the most awkward and inconvenient places. I've seen better timed jokes at funerals than this movie. Half of them don't make any sense either.</p>

  <p>You can't even accept this film as a schlocky action movie either. There is a constant assault on your senses. Constant explosions and buildings crashing down are backed up with a dreadful score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. It's hard enough to hear myself think as I watched building after building crash down, but add in screaming electric guitars and drums getting the living daylights hit out of them and I'm surprised I didn't get a brain aneurysm. There's no melodies, just constant stabbing sounds. The fight sequences have no fluidity and shot in such a way that it's hard to tell what's going on, even if you did care about the characters. The only fight I actually enjoyed was an assault Batman had on a building. It reminded me of the <em>Arkham</em> games in terms of capturing the rhythm and the emphasis on subterfuge. That was a genuinely brilliant fight. It's a shame all the other sequences are just explosions and special effects.</p>

  <p>If you hadn't guessed by now, I can't possibly recommend this film in the slightest. Maybe YouTube the Batman assault, but leave it at that. The film is stupid and incoherent. The characters are reprehensible. The soundtrack will drive you nuts. The fight sequences are not engaging in the slightest. The performances are generally poor. The only things this film has going for it are, one good fight sequence, two good performances by Irons and Affleck and the odd moment of excellent cinematography. Perhaps you may get some ironic enjoyment out of Jesse Eisenberg (to be fair, I enjoyed it more when he appeared), but it's not enough to see this film. Avoid this film, don't give any money to it otherwise you'll just encourage them to make more.</p>
