<div class="Body">

    <p>There are so many problems with the plot of this movie that it would probably be better to list them, like Buzzfeed. However, I feel more compelled to write about them in detail, if only to give me the opportunity to have some bizarre form of therapy. I shouldn't be surprised by the incomprehensible nature of the plot considering the film opens with a young Bruce Wayne being lifted by bats. The bats aren't a symbol of hope Zack, they're a symbol of fear. If you're talking about how fear is a form of hope, that's a philosophical discussion for another time, but surely that is a form of contradiction.</p>

    <p>Lex Luthor's plot, from what I can understand, is to destroy Superman's reputation so Batman would fight him. Quite why he wants to do this is not entirely clear because all he ever says is some vague guff about how Superman is a god and man must defeat God (like a GCSE student who's just discovered Nietzsche). If we accept that he wants to destroy Superman's reputation so Batman would fight him, how he goes about it makes even less sense that the motivation behind it. Furthermore, there's no need to destroy Superman's reputation considering the events of the last film.</p>

    <p>He begins by framing Superman for the death of some terrorists that he had shot. Why on earth would Lex think that killing a group of terrorists will turn the American public against Superman? Furthermore, he's assuming that Congress will be dumb enough to think Superman was responsible even though the corpses are riddled with bullet holes. Fortunately for him, they are. Lois Lane does try to investigate this, but she confronts Lex only to be shoved off a tower. During the hearing, Luthor  blows up Congress during Superman's questioning, possibly to frame him, even though all footage and crime scene investigation would show it was a bomb on the wheelchair.
    It's even more redundant considering the news within minutes were reporting that it wasn't Superman. So there's a series of deaths to frame Superman in order to destroy his reputation that are quite clearly not his fault or responsibility. I have no idea why Lex would think that 'world's greatest detective' will be taken in by this and why he would take it upon himself to try and defeat Superman, but luckily for Lex, Batman is gullible and predictable. Lord knows why Lex would think Batman would win. If Superman is as powerful as Lex says he is, why is he worried if he assumes Batman is more powerful?</p>

    <p>In the background to all of this Lex is given the power to access Zod's corpse and ship. I won't even try to begin to understand how he got enough power to access the most confidential piece of information and technology the American Government would ever have access to. I'll try even less to understand how he could get away with it without constant security checks. He uses Zod and the ship to create an orc (yes, I know it's Doomsday), to defeat Superman. If he was going to all of this effort, why bother with the Batman plan? He surely has greater control over Doomsday than Batman?</p>

    <p>In this entire plan though, what on earth convinces Superman to fight Batman? Lex has Superman's earth mother, Martha Kent (Diane Lane), hostage, so Superman needs to fight Batman. Did anyone else just see a great leap in logic? If Superman can hear Lois Lane being pushed off a tower in the middle of the city and save her within seconds, why can't he work out where Martha is? Furthermore, why does he not try to convince Batman to be on side? He barely even tries to convince Batman that his mother is in danger. The end of the fight shows all he needed to say was that he needs to 'save Martha' (it's the magic password that puts Batman into pacifist mode).</p>

    <p>So we have one fighter that are motivated by the desire to save the world from the TV monster and one that wants to hit someone irrelevant over his mum's capture. Relatively dumb reasons to start a fight. But the fight ends because Superman says he needs to save 'Martha', instead of saying he needs to save his mother, like a normal person. The fact Batman's mother is also called 'Martha' is the reason he stops fighting. This is further proof Zack Snyder has no idea how people work and further evidence that Synder sees people as fundamentally selfish.
    The fact both have mothers might just make sense as motivation, as Batman sees that Superman is a misunderstood person too and one that loves his family (it's flimsy, but tolerable). Putting the name 'Martha' at the forefront of the conversation ensures that the end of the fight becomes about the name. The name doesn't matter, the emotion does. Would Batman have killed Superman if Martha Kent had a different name? Snyder allows us to infer that the fight ends because Batman thinks of his own mother, not because Batman has empathy.</p>
