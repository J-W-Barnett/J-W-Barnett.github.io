<div class="Body">

<p>For a movie entitled <em>Legend</em>, this movie doesn’t exactly excite you or pack a punch. You’d expect <em>Legend</em> to either reinforce or challenge the perception that the Kray twins were glamorous and aspirational figures. In the end it doesn’t do either one of these. As an audience we get *time* of historical events. What’s the theme or point of the story? What was *director* trying to say?</p>

<p>That’s not to say that this movie wasn’t attempting to make some points, the problem is the points were not focused or underdeveloped. Plots generally have a central problem that needs to be resolved and the characters and/or audience ultimately learning a lesson from the character’s experiences. Understandably simplistic plots like this are problematic when creating a biographical movie because life doesn’t follow a basic narrative structure. But by examining a lot of events, this movie swings from one event to the next without any sort of coherent flow, making it harder to follow as a viewer.</p>

<p>I’ll confess that I currently study History, meaning that I’m bound to want something a bit more ‘meaty’. But to me, movies such as the <em>Damned United</em> or <em>Rush</em> are particularly brilliant biographical films, because they focus on one key event. It gives us a deeper understanding of the characters and how certain situations affected them, furthermore it allows us to analyse an event and to unravel important reasons why the event happened. <em>Legend</em>, by looking at everything, makes it harder for us to comprehensively understand such details about significant events. The movie then ends up feeling like a Wikipedia entry more than a story.</p>

<p>The lack of authenticity and dimension isn't helped by Brian Helgeland. The movie lacks any true emotion. Any violent sequence doesn't feel menacing or fun, they only felt function. Sure, the punch-up between the two brothers is expertly shot, but I just didn't feel any sort of emotion towards the sequence. I didn't care enough for the characters to care about why they're fighting and the fight was too realistic to find it funny. The romance lacks any real heart or tragedy as every part of the romance is just told to you instead of shown to you. I don't see that Reggie loves Frances, I just see a man and a woman talking about how attracted they are to each other. Everything just felt like it was a place holder so that Tom Hardy make a show reel to send to any casting directors.</p>

<p>As much as people are praising Mr Hardy, who I feel is a terrific actor generally, I can't hep but feel that his performance didn't help in terms of tone. Reggie is attempting serious business and Ronnie is running around like a heftier John Inman. One is dramatic, the other is comedic. Such a dynamic is fine in a comedy, but it completely undermines any brutal sequences, plus it feels like a genuine disservice to Ronnie. Ronnie was undoubtedly an interesting person and there's a lot about him to unravel and unpack. He shouldn't be reduced to a caricature because he was a genuinely conflicted and extremely dangerous man.</p>

<p>Even if this film was aiming for comedy, it fell flat. The focus on the tragic romance between Reggie and <span class="st">Frances </span><span class="st">Shea </span><span class="st">is not a comedy goldmine. Wife beating isn't my idea of comedy. Furthermore the idea we're supposed to laugh at Ronnie's homosexual tendencies is rather uncomfortable too.</span> The comedy gangster genre is incredibly difficult to carry off and has only truly been mastered by Jason Statham. The Stath tends to deliver a strong irony behind his performances, which endear audiences to the movie. <em>Legend </em>has no such irony. Besides, any attempt to make the Kray twins comedic will come up short against the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBL3XB-PhE8"><em>Monty Python</em> parody</a>.</p>

<p>The only way it is feasible to watch this film is to watch it as a piece that is representative of the weird nostalgia that some Londoners have about the twins and the era that they lived in. The music and the use of long tracking shots certainly stylise 1960's London in a very superficial way. If you want to spend some time in that fantasy depiction, there is some enjoyment to be had with this movie. To me however, this is all style and no substance. I didn't find it terribly enjoyable because I couldn't even appreciate from a technical level as each sequence felt so jarring. I personally wouldn't recommend seeing this film. If you want fun gangsters, watch <em>Crank</em>. If you want stylish gangsters, watch <em>Goodfellas</em>. If you want realistic character breakdowns watch <em>The Long Good Friday</em>.</p>
