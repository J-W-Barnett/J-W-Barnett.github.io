  <p>I honestly tried to go in with as open a mind a possible. I didn't read any reviews or look at box office figures etc. I went in only with the knowledge it was based on a Dr Seuss book and had Mike Myers in it; the two should balance out for me. I like Mike Myers, but I'm not fond of Dr Seuss (not that I dislike him, I just feel his work is overhyped).</p>

  <p>The big problem was that I found all of the performances irritating. When I say <em>all</em>, I mean <em>all</em>. I generally find kids annoying in films but I give them a chance. Some kids can be very talented, <span class="st">Elliot Speller-Gillott</span> or Chloe Grace Moretz to name two, but these kids were annoying and I just didn't believe in their characters. I actually wanted the little brats to get into trouble. Never mind sending them to military school, put them on the firing range! Failing that just get the other Michael Myers to pay them a visit.</p>

  <p>All the adults are pretty bad too. It's way too over the top. At this point, you could argue that this is to represent the cartoon universe and the performances are suitably 2-D, but then you just have no sympathy for any character; you can't relate to cardboard cut outs of people with a dentist's smile. It's not like<em> American Psycho</em>, which is illustrating a point about the superficial nature of capitalism. You're not supposed to relate to the characters in that. I'll get onto why that doesn't work in this film later.</p>

  <p>The real frustrating thing is just how annoying Mike Myers is in this film. I loved him in <em>Wayne's World</em> and <em>Austin Powers</em>, but he isn't funny in this film. He appears to be doing a weird version of the Cowardly Lion, but with asthma. His breaking of the fourth wall doesn't work either considering we don't relate to him. Breaking the fourth wall works if you're in a weird situation and you're the only sane person. Harry Hill used it well in <em>TV Burp</em>, reacting to the weirdness he just witnessed.
  Basil Exposition uses it well in <em>Austin Powers</em> too, to reassure the audience to just ignore the stuff that doesn't make sense. But Myers is so weird, you can't relate to what he's saying. There's no in joke. It's just a big fur ball doing his best Jim Carey impression. If everyone else is ramped up in the weirdness stakes, there's no-one to react to the weirdness. You've got to have the reactions to the weirdness. <em>Bunny and the Bull</em> certainly had it. This film doesn't.</p>

  <p>The film's is flawed too. I don't understand who this film is aimed towards. The jokes are too adult based for kids and there is no depth to the film for the adults to enjoy, just lazy innuendo. It's not a commentary on Dr Seuss, because there is no critique of that universe. In the earlier example of <em>American Psycho</em>, you can see a performance behind Christian Bale's eyes and meticulous details, which paint the superficial world (as seen by his obsession over business cards and the preference of Phil Collin's Genesis to Peter Gabriel's and the big twist). <em>The Cat in the Hat</em> essentially follows the ordinary Hollywood narrative, with no comments about the story.</p>

  <p>The better moments in the <em>Austin Powers</em> films are when Dr Evil monologues because it essentially critiques the Bond films and points out a flaw. The placing of Dr Evil in the group therapy session also serves to highlight the ludicrous nature of the character. In T<em>he Cat in the Hat</em>, there are no such references or subversions. They even have the whole 'plinky plonk piano emotion scene' used without irony, when the kids make a change in their life. Sticking penis jokes into a kids' film doesn't make it a parody, it makes it a stereotypical and puerile kids' film. Most kids films contain some sort of innuendo. <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Shrek</em> are but two examples. At least they are well-made.</p>

  <p>A stronger example of a Dr Seuss parody is <em>South Park's</em> 'Woodland Critter Christmas' episode, in which Stan is a reluctant protagonist, there's anti-Semitism and the supposedly cute creatures have not-so pleasant motives. The narrator used a Dr Seuss like rhyming scheme in order to sanitise the unpleasant underpinnings in children's stories. That particular <em>South Park</em> episode wasn't exclusively Dr Seuss, it was more children's books in general, but the point is still relevant. You could point to the way that the Taiwanese are represented as a means of providing this commentary in <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>. That however would miss the point, in the aforementioned <em>South Park</em> example, characters such as Stan and Kyle actively disapprove of the vile viewpoints. No-one disapproves of the racism in <em>The Cat in the Hat</em>, it merely exists as a form of lazy joke.</p>

  <p>In terms of further annoyances:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>The soundtrack was annoying, distracting and at some points incredibly generic.</li>
  	<li>There was a lot of filler for something only 80 minutes long.</li>
  	<li>Paris Hilton, why was she there? To give the other characters more depth?</li>
  	<li>Way too much CGI.</li>
  	<li>The weightlessness when jumping on the sofa irritated me.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fundamentally though, it's the lack of consequences that are the main problem. On a minor scale, the weightlessness when jumping on the sofas doesn't make you believe the kids are in danger when they're having any 'fun'. But the way in which the film ends due to a contract loophole (at this point I don't care if you think this is a spoiler, if you have any sense you won't watch it anyway) also shows a lack of consequence. What's the lesson kids? Mess up all you want, a large fur-ball will sort everything out for you.</p>

  <p>All films have flaws (well... apart from maybe <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em>), but all films have positives too and credit due where credit is due- the production design was very good. The garish colour scheme and house design suited a cartooney ascetic. It was a bit like a Tim Burton film. This isn't particularly surprising considering Bo Welch was the art director on <em>Edward Scissorhands</em> and <em>Beetlejuice</em>.</p>

  <p>Problem is though, you can't sustain a film on production design alone and the real flaw is that ultimately there was no substance. Not recommended.</p>
