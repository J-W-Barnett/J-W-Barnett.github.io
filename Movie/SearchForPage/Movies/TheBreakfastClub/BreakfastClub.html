  <p>Jim Kerr commands you to not forget about him and if I'm honest it's the only truly memorable thing about this movie. <em>The Breakfast Club</em> is not going to sit with me like other coming of age films like <em>Kes</em>, <em>This is England</em> or <em>Submarine</em>. That's not to say the film is inherently problematic, but at the same time I don't feel it says anything profound. Perhaps I'm so used to the tropes of a coming of age movie that I don't have a particular fondness for this movie or perhaps I'm too old to appreciate it's core message.</p>

  <p>From the outset the plot and theme is pretty much laid bare. The supposed ne'er-do-wells are tasked with writing an essay about who they think they are. It seems fairly obvious from there the trajectory of the plot and surely enough events happen as expected. Such a predictable plot-line can be problematic purely because you're awaiting the next plot point to happen and can often result in scenes feeling over-laboured. Furthermore, the ending felt too idealised. The characters are portrayed as learning to transcend their problems, yet I feel the pressures they feel would undo the lesson they learnt within the space of half a day. In fact it's hard to believe the way in which character relationships develop within the space of half a day. I'm completely on board with idealisation, but at the same time the movie is so grounded in a form of realism that I expect the film to develop in a more realistic way.</p>

  <p>A bigger problem for me is that each character is a stereotype and as much as the movie expects you to look past these stereotypes ultimately the stereotypes are reinforced. Each character talks about their own pressures and how these pressures result in them attending detention, but the pressures feel clichéd. I don't want to add spoilers so I won't discuss them, but it's fairly obvious what pressures an athlete, a bad boy, a popular girl, a nerd and a weird girl all face. Perhaps it would've been interesting to see the motivations and pressures swapped around. Speaking as someone you could define as a 'nerd', I feel and have felt the pressures the other social groups have felt too. Boiling down the character's pressures and motivations so simply merely serves to undermine the main point of the movie. Understandably though, when you have a ninety minute run time, you may have to take some liberties with the characterisation.</p>

  <p>In terms of the more technical aspects of film making, <em>The Breakfast Club</em> is serviceable. There's nothing particularly egregious about the cinematography, the mise-en-scene, soundtrack or acting, I just don't feel there's anything spectacular about these aspects of film making either. The performances are up to scratch, but the actors don't provide an extra dimension to the characters, they perform them as believable stereotypes. The sequences are usually filmed in a sequence of close ups, which is rather standard film making, but somewhat understandable as it creates a more intimate atmosphere and encourages the audience to get closer to the characters. The camera isn't completely '<em>Star Wars</em> prequel' and does on occasion move. Yet, I felt like the movement had no sufficient purpose than just moving for the sake of moving. I personally prefer camera movements incorporated into the movie, but at least the film wasn't completely stationary.</p>

  <p>I don't begrudge anyone who takes more from this film than I did. Perhaps over time the clichés discussed by <em>The Breakfast Club</em> have been perpetuated to the point that the film feels like it has become a cliché film. Perhaps I just have an affinity with more elaborate and fantastical ways to present teenagers growing up, for instance I have a lot of time for the films <em>Brick</em> and <em>Scott Pilgrim vs The World</em>. Maybe I just struggle with films representing the struggles teenagers go through because of their somewhat, yet necessary, oversimplification.
  The medium of television provides more detail. I have a huge fondness for <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>,<em> The Inbetweeners</em> and <em>Uncle </em>and they represent different issues I had growing up in more detail. Even <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air </em>taught me a lot about growing up and taught me a lot about the difficulties of growing up outside of my own experience, particularly if you were black and from a rougher area like Philedelphia.</p>

  <p>In essence this isn't a film that appeals to my own personal tastes and is not something I expect to stick with me in the future. I wouldn't personally encourage you to actively seek out this film. This is not to say that you should just dismiss it off hand either, if you have a sufficient curiosity in this film, it may be worth checking out, if you don't have the interest don't make the effort to see it. Half-recommended.</p>
