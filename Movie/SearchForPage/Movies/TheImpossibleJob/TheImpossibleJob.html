<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GB1KTIACtk" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">The Art of Making A Football Documentary</a></h2>
<div class="Body">
  <p>I'm sure it comes as no surprise to those who follow my other blog that I am a football fanatic! I have a season ticket at Preston North End, who I simultaneously love and hate in only a way you'd understand if you had an obsession. I don't half feel at times that the Buzzcocks song <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51OB2YoC4sg">Ever Fallen in Love (with Someone You Shouldn't've)</a> </em>is actually a song about the band's local football team. I write up my views on the matches I attend, I read many books and articles on football, I have written my dissertations on football related topics and I have spent far too many hours on football manager. It's fair to say that when a football documentary comes around, it grabs my interest, so I feel the need to write a review of perhaps the greatest football documentary of all time.</p>

  <p>Why review a television documentary that was broadcast when I was only days old? For a few reasons really. Firstly, because of Graham Taylor's passing. I feel this is a documentary that was used unfairly against him after his resignation as England manager. Secondly, it's relevance to the England nation football team today. Thirdly, because it is a fine example of a well executed fly on the wall documentary. Finally, because it's a damn entertaining documentary, so much so I'd bracket it with <em>Senna </em>as sports documentaries people with no interest in sport will enjoy.</p>

  <p>I'll refrain from writing t00 much football analysis in this review, so instead, I'll begin with the 'meat and potatoes' of this documentary. It has a perfect mix of factors that contribute to being a highly watchable fly on the wall sports documentary, namely it was in the right place at the right time, many of the participants are unaware that they are being filmed and it focuses on the off the field drama.</p>

  <p>Quite often fly on the wall documentaries are quite dry because they capture the ordinary. The ordinary can be very dull. People live ordinary lives every day, why would they want to watch it? Furthermore, when things are ordinary and you place cameras in that situation, you end up with highly managed situations as people in the documentary do not want to appear extraordinary or try their best to appear extraordinary. In terms of the timing of this documentary, the filming started as a means of comparing club management to international management.
  But during the filming, the results plummeted and Graham Taylor's position was put under pressure. The dynamics of the documentary then change to a character study and when there is a crisis such as this it's far easier to catch people off guard as their mind lies somewhere else than the filming and a truer reflection of the person appears. In terms of the place, placing cameras in an international football stadium is perfect for hiding in plain sight. You can easily film the staff, the fans, the journalists as well as the players. Cameras are so natural to that environment that people are constantly caught off guard as the camera doesn't become a unique and distracting object. The only difference in this situation is where this camera is pointing.</p>

  <p>During the documentary crew were absolutely correct in keeping as many cameras as possible focused on the management. It sounds incredibly simple, but we don't need to see football matches being filmed, as access to match footage is incredibly easy to obtain, yet the amount of football documentaries that have a break to play match highlights is frustrating. It ruins the pacing and tone, but is also frustrating for the audience. Non-football fans do not have much of an interest in watching football and football fans watch these documentaries to see a side of the game they aren't used to seeing.
  We only need match moments in order to provide context to any reactions we see. <em>An Impossible Job </em>balances this correctly, the focus is on Graham Taylor and the only match highlights we see are the ones that cause him to react in an emotional way. As an audience, we learn to see the situation from Taylor's perspective and come to understand him more as a person. Furthermore, because all else is focused on the match, Taylor is focused on the match and we see his behaviour when he's off guard.</p>

  <p>Ignoring the match side of things, this documentary simply excels in capturing people off guard. There is a press conference in which the camera focuses entirely on the press instead of Taylor, again capturing genuine emotion by hiding in plain sight. We see the pressures on Taylor when he's having to put on a media performance and learn more about Taylor as a consequence. All of this process is helped by the minimum amount of commentary. We learn to empathise with the people inside the documentary and how to understand them. Having a voice over in this situation would detach us as an audience from the subject matter and when we're dealing with such an emotional subject.</p>

  <p>I could continue further in describing how this documentary is put together incredibly well, but all documentaries need an engaging subject and they certainly found it with Graham Taylor as England manager! On the face of things, it's hard to empathise with managers because of their completely different lifestyles and because of the way in which sport is media managed. Taylor, however, as the documentary unravels feels like an ordinary fan.</p>

  <p>In part, this is what makes the documentary as funny as it is. You have this impeccably dressed and mild mannered man, who in the face of the media is professional and courteous. When he talked tactics, he talked with a degree of knowledge. Yet, when on the touchline, he rants, he swears and his tactical advise is very much reactionary more so than thought out. The contradiction itself is hilarious! Yet, there is a relatable  quality to this. He reminds me of many people I've been with in football matches and different events. To be honest, he reminds me of my Grandad. You'd funny expect to mock a figure that lambastes his player for being in the box after he's scored a goal and gives out advise such as 'Can we not knock it?', yet Taylor is thoroughly endearing in this documentary. When this documentary laughs, it laughs with Taylor and not at him.</p>

  <p>The director and the editors clearly felt it necessary to show some of the really positive and often undervalued aspects of Graham Taylor as a man. Two sequences in particular stand out. Firstly, when he flew out to Italy to talk to David Platt about taking the captaincy away from him. This showed the kind hearted nature of the man. This could easily have been something he could've done over the phone or by letter. Yet he felt the need to fly out to another country and tell Platt face to face.
  We learn he understands responsibility and will not run away from it, but also that he values the people that work for him. One could be cynical and say this was a means for him to look good on camera, yet we mustn't ignore that he clearly knows what's right if he thought of it in the first place and this was a decision of no real consequence. If the film crew sensed any manipulation, I doubt they'd have left it in. The second, and more important, sequence is when Taylor addresses a racist supporter in the crowd. It would've been easy for him to ignore it, especially in a highly pressured situation when his own job is at risk and his popularity fading  yet he takes time away from the match to confront a man over something far more important than football. As well as showing the morality of the man, we see what a farce football is in comparison to the more important matters in life.</p>

  <p><em>An Impossible Job</em> could not be a more apt title. It's easy to laugh and to point at some of the situations that occur in the documentary, but the documentary does an incredible and rather subtle job of conveying just how much the odds were against Taylor succeeding. The start of the documentary shows the unwarranted abuse Taylor was getting from the media and the press conferences throughout serve to show us just how much reporters were willing to try and expose him. Rob Sheppard's argument is a key moment in the programme and it's no coincidence that he is one of the journalists filmed at the end, talking about Taylor's failure in terms a Bond villain would use. Saying a man must 'Pay the price' for failure is somewhat hyperbolic when talking about football don't you think?</p>

  <p>Regardless of the press, we are treated to shots of Paul Gascoigne and Ian Wright playing up to the camera. There are shots of players like Paul Merson and Nigel Clough on the bench, neither or whom were big international successes. We effectively see the self centred nature of some of the players who want to be the main focus and we see the lack of suitable replacements Taylor had. It is of course hindsight that makes you see this point in particular, but it's clear that anyone could have struggled as the England manager given these resources.</p>

  <p>Amongst all of this pressure though, Taylor still comes out incredibly well. It would be fair to criticise his tactics. It would be fair to laugh with his touchline manner and behaviour as well as some of the decisions he makes. But it wouldn't be fair to laugh at the man. Despite all of the pressure, he thought about others and tried his best. His worry when the press came after him is the effect it had on his family, it wasn't for himself.</p>

  <p><em>An Impossible Job</em> is misunderstood in some circles really. Some look at it as an out and out comedy where we laugh at an Alan Partridge like figure. The reality is that Taylor was more like Captain Mainwaring from <em>Dad's Army</em>. We have a man who tried his best and sometimes we have humours results, but there is an underlying pathos and tragedy to it all. He was an underdog in a position he shouldn't necessarily have been in, but he clearly cared deeply about his country and those around him. He would be a target for simply being himself. We shouldn't mock him for being that man. This documentary makes that clear. As an audience laughed at Taylor exclaiming 'Do I not like that!' as England concede, but moments later we feel a deep melancholy when he meekly whispers to the Linesman 'I'm just saying to your colleague, the referee has got me the sack. Thank him ever so much for that, won't you?'</p>

  <p>This documentary is incredibly well crafted and it's not hard to see why it inspired <em>Mike Bassett: England Manager </em>and characters in the vein of David Brent. It is funny and tragic. It is insightful and a farce. The team behind the documentary did an expert job pulling all of this together and should be commended for bringing Graham Taylor to the attention of my generation. This documentary allows us to see what Taylor was like as a man and to see for ourselves what an inspirational figure he actually was and we don't have to rely on aggressive news outlets. Thanks to this documentary, I don't see a 'Turnip', I see a gentle and passionate man. If you are a football fan, definitely see this documentary and if you aren't please give it a try, don't see it as a documentary on football, but as a documentary on the farce surrounding football and the consequences it has on an absolute gentleman.</p>

  <p>Rest in Peace Graham Taylor.</p>
