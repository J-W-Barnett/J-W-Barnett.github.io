  <p>It is no secret that I am a fan of both science-fiction and of Terry Gilliam so when the two become intertwined once more I’ll always eagerly anticipate the result. His unique grasp of cinematography and mise-en-scene never fails to interest me, as I’ve said time and time again, the man just doesn’t do boring. Once again, the trend continues.</p>

  <p>Once again I’m immersed in the world that Gilliam creates, his laser focus on detail means that the world he creates feels authentic and that you need to watch the film again and again to truly appreciate the craft that has gone into the films. One tiny example is the magnifying glass on the cameraball, ensuring that it draws parallels between the people who ran underground society and the psychiatrists. I know there’s so much more that I’ve missed.</p>

  <p>As with most of his films it is thematically strong, raising issues relating to the laws of time, death, madness truth and consumerism. Quite a lot of it can be seen through Foucaltian theory, which is essentially that the only truth in society is who has power to direct discourse. Foucault himself studied psychiatry to illustrate his theory, the film reflects this focus on the power psychiatry. The end of the film expands on this in modern society by mentioning insurance companies as well. Yet the film can throw so many ideas at you without making you feel stupid. The film takes you on its course of insanity, through its mise-en-scene and its camera angles (specifically the Dutch tilts), something prevalent in <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas </em>as well. I could go on forever about how much thematic heft this film carries, but I’ll spare you the dissertation.</p>

  <p>To get to the more bread and butter elements of film making, the cast is fantastic. It’s weird to see Bruce Willis care about a performance, I’ve forgotten what that looked like. It’s not a cliché performance from him either, he doesn’t do the 'blue eyes stare' that we all know him for. Brad Pitt also puts in a powerhouse performance, fully encompassing the role of the insane inmate. It’s again a testimony to Gilliam for getting these performances through the simplest of ways; firstly by drawing a list of things Bruce Willis isn’t allowed to do and secondly, by confiscating Brad Pitt’s cigarettes. So simple, yet no other director ever thinks of this.</p>

  <p>The soundtrack is pretty solid as well, memorable and used appropriately. It’s clever to represent its French origins within the soundtrack, while at the same time encompassing the insanity and the mystery. Perhaps it got a bit repetitive though.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately that’s the main criticism of the film I’ve got really, it’s kind of repetitive. By that I mean a lot of the themes discussed in <em>Twelve Monkeys</em> have already appeared so many times in Gilliam’s other movies, <em>Brazil</em> being the prime example of this. The time travel element in terms of not being able to change events and being the harbinger of your own doom is already a theme that’s been done many times. So much so that it wasn’t a surprise when it happened. The weakest part for me was the romance element that was injected into the film. It just didn’t feel organic. While I understand James having an obsession with Kathryn, I don’t understand why Kathryn would fall for James. The pressure of the end of the world and the fact she’s only started to believe James to me doesn’t result in a romantic interest. Why can’t a man and a woman work together in a film without falling in love? Another reason to love <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> I suppose.</p>

  <p>Still, I suppose that predicting the twist is largely my responsibility, considering my obsession with time travel (being a <em>Doctor Who</em> fan and all). This plot was used by Shakespeare in one of his most famous plays so it’s bit difficult to have some idea about the ultimate destination of the film. Furthermore, while these themes have been approached before in Gilliam’s other films, he is still the best person to discuss and approach them. Doesn’t mean it’s any less entertaining though. Just being a bit nitpicky really. It’s a Gilliam film; it’s funny, unique and smart. What more do you want?</p>
