  <p>It is a great shame that in this current climate that I have to put a disclaimer at the start of this review. Quite simply I have no problem with female lead movies and no problem with female lead comedies and I can point to many funny women. Tina Fey and Amy Pholer are hilarious. Aubrey Plaza may be my favourite performer on <em>Parks and Recreation</em>. Jennifer Saunders is one of the greatest comedy talents of our time. Caroline Aherne is a genius as a writer and actor. I could continue to name different shows and female performers that I admire hugely, but that would be to waste a lot more space in a piece that should be focused on this movie. Quite simply woman can be funny, but not all women are. It is not sexist to suggest that this movie is unfunny and that the wrong women have been used. It is sexist to suggest it isn't funny because there are women in general involved and the abuse some of the cast has received has been disgraceful.</p>

  <p>I'll start this review by pointing at perhaps the biggest problem with this movie, which is the male director Paul Feig. Decent comedy is disciplined. You can allow your actors to improvise, but you need to have a strong script in case the improvisation isn't very good. <em>The Thick of It </em>would shoot each sequence at least twice, once where the cast follows the script and once where the actors are allowed to improvise. It would allow the director to choose which sequence he felt was funnier. This interpretation of <em>Ghostbusters </em>seemed to be heavily reliant on improvisation and needed Feig to step in and have a tighter control over the scenes. The sequence in which Patty (Leslie Jones) is walking around the basement grumbling about why she is part of the Ghostbusters was clearly improvised, but wasn't particularly funny as it was at complete odds with the character. She chose to sign up and did so against the will of the others. She'd already seen ghosts and wasn't too scared. As a viewer it left me horribly confused and unengaged in the supposed comedy of the sequence. A stronger director would've ensured that the character motivations remained consistent. If Leslie Jones needed to improvise,  Feig could've ensured she improvised in a manner consistent with the rest of the movie.</p>

  <p>Even during scenes when there wasn't much improvisation, Feig's direction severely reduced the impact of any potential comedy. One such example is when a ghost is hit by a train. The sequence is shot from multiple angles, which drags the length of the joke out further and allows the audience time to process what they just saw. Typically, when a character is hit by a vehicle or falls over you should only have one take as it is the surprise that creates the laughter. One of the reasons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rcdLeXiU8">Del Boy falling through the bar</a> is considered so funny is because it was one shot. Furthermore, jokes work on a pull back and reveal basis. When you don't expect the punchline, jokes are funnier. By using multiple angles, it's akin to telling the same joke over and over again in quick succession. Each time it's told, it's impact is reduced and just becomes annoying. There's no point in this movie either where there are basic edited jokes or jokes used by the camera. If you haven't seen this video essay already, I encourage you to check out Every Frame A Painting's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FOzD4Sfgag">video about Edgar Wright</a>.That will explain my point better than I can.</p>

  <p>Feig has to take responsibility because of his script too. It's nothing more than a copy of the original movie in terms of it's plot, except it's slightly ramped up. The problem is when you ramp up extreme circumstances it's inherently less funny. Basic comedy comes from undervaluing extreme circumstances and overvaluing minor circumstances. In <em>Shaun of the Dead</em>, characters like Shaun don't take a zombie apocalypse as seriously as he should. In <em>Hot Fuzz </em>the antagonists have murdered people for relatively minor reasons.
  There's nothing funny about situations being given appropriate responses. Furthermore this film attempts to make sure that all of the characters are funny. Comedy inherently needs serious characters to react to the absurdity of the funny characters and funny situations. The audience needs a serious character that they can relate to in order to react to the surreal things they're seeing. It allows contrast with the absurdity and grounds the movie in a sense of reality. Without Oliver Hardy, Stan Laurel's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDrYVzb5KAU">stranger moments</a> wouldn't be funny. Without the people surrounding Frank Drebbin, we don't understand what an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1o2Em_Ona8">incompetent detective </a>he is.</p>

  <p>The movie lacks any sort of basic understanding about character progression too. Kristen Wiig's character seems to have a multitude of different potential arcs, namely reconciling with Melissa McCarthey's character, proving that ghosts exist to a sceptical scientific community and possibly getting together with Chris Hemsworth. In Wiig's case, <em>Ghostbusters </em>jumps around different potential points of character development and pretty much resolves them within a matter of scenes. On the other end of the spectrum, the other three characters have very little room to develop.
  Melissa McCarthey's main objective is to become friends with Wiig again, which she does within half an hour of the movie's start. Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon have pretty much no purpose in the movie other than just to fill criteria. It's important in an ensemble movie to have all of your leads progress and in their own manner. <em>A Fish Called Wanda</em> manages to do this, John Cleese is looking for romance, Jamie Lee Curtis is looking for wealth and Michael Palin is looking for a quiet life looking after animals. Even as a group the <em>Ghostbusters</em> have no progression.
  There's no conflict between the characters (apart from the first 30 minutes if that), there's no-one they have an ideological struggle with (apart from a few throw away cameos by Charles Dance and Bill Murray), there's no basic crisis at the heart of the group. They don't even struggle against the main villain, they beat him in their first attempt and again in their second. The original movie had a central struggle and that was against bureaucracy and even that isn't apparent in this movie. The conflict with the Government exists purely as a means to imitate the original movie.</p>

  <p>To mask it's fundamental flaws, the script and the film focuses on how 'progressive' it is. Again, I have no problems with a female led cast and I feel it is progressive to have a female lead cast, but you can't seriously interpret this script as truly progressive when Patty could be considered a racist stereotype. She's the only black character, yet she is the only working class member of the Ghostbusters team. She is also frequently given scenes where she runs around and screams compared to the other cast members. The movie doesn't suitably call out the stereotype to be considered irony. It just has all of these assumptions about race and doesn't challenge them. Furthermore for a large section of the film we see Kristen Wiig pining after Chris Hemsworth, which can seen as sexist too. A woman finding a muscle-bound man attractive despite his flaws could understandably be seen as problematic.</p>

  <p>In terms of performances, I can't point to anyone I was satisfied with. Kate McKinnon was perhaps the most grating of the main four. She is talented and her<em> Saturday Night Performances</em> prove this, but in this movie she was incredibly annoying. She had no discernible characteristic other than 'weird'. Awkward movements and gurning is not an endearing type of weirdness, it's confusing and frustrating. It's how a child interprets weirdness. Endearing weirdness comes from being aloof. It comes from not understanding basic human interactions, it's why <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>'s Sheldon Cooper is popular (even if I'm not a fan of him) and why the Doctor (from <em>Doctor Who</em>) is also popular. Kristen Wiig looked more bored than a chartered accountant waiting in line at the post office. Melissa McCarthey had no real character. Leslie Jones played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODeWKTKkN2Y">Mammy Two Shoes </a>from the old <em>Tom and Jerry</em> cartoons.</p>

  <p>I've heard people talk up Chris Hemsworth's character, but he isn't convincingly stupid. Two of the best performances of stupid characters are Hugh Laurie as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOSYiT2iG08">George in <em>Blackadder</em></a> and Ardal O'Hanlon as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_xOfxY5n2U">Father Dougal in</a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_xOfxY5n2U"> Father Ted</a></em>. Both of these performances managed to capture the sheer stupidity of the characters by being so dead behind the eyes. Their wide eyes captured a sense of naivety and wonderment these characters were feeling towards the world around them. Chris Hemsworth doesn't do this, he just smiles as if a smile is supposed to reflect stupidity. Happiness isn't exclusive to the stupid, it's just more easily embraced by them. But his monotone voice hardly conveys any awe or wonder either.</p>

  <p>I could keep going on about how thoroughly unenjoyable this movie is and how much it misses the mark, but it truly is futile to do so as this review is long enough anyway. I don't recommend this film at all, it fails from just about every angle and is most certainly not a iconic feminist film. This is a film designed to sell pringles and sell Fall Out Boy songs. If you want top quality feminist science-fiction, watch <em>Alien</em> or T<em>he Terminator</em>. If you want feminist comedy, watch <em>Juno</em> or <em>Mean Girls</em>, which are funny female lead films. Don't waste your time with this <em>Ghostbusters</em>. Not recommended in the slightest.</p>
