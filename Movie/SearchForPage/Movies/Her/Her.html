<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzV6mXIOVl4" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">Giving Hollywood A Much Needed Update!</a></h2>
<div class="Body">
  <p>It’s hard not to sound glib when I say this but, I feel in love with this movie. I now understand how it feels for a man to fall in love with an inanimate object, much like the protagonist of this movie. This is a movie that will live long in my memory and hit me at an emotional level and Hollywood in it’s current state could learn a lot of lessons from this movie. I honestly don’t know where to begin talking about this movie, it just doesn’t fail in any aspect of movie making. It’s script is strong as it’s characters are completely believable and it doesn’t treat the subject manner as clumsily as other films would have. The direction is superb in terms of visual storytelling, in terms of getting the best out of it’s actors and in terms of immersing you into this world. The performances are phenomenal too! Take a bow Spike Jonze, you have created a modern masterpiece!</p>

  <p>Since I just wrote about Jonze, I suppose the best place to start would be his script. As Mike and Jay of <em>Red Letter Media </em>have <a href="https://youtu.be/3zTHQznVs00?t=1030">discussed</a>, this premise, a man falling in love with his Operating System (OS), could have been written in so many other ways. It could have been a comedy or a horror, much like <em>The Simpsons </em>episode <em>Treehouse of Horror XII</em>, where Pierce Brosnan plays an OS that falls in love with Marge. It could have been more cliché and focused on the idea that a man is going insane as he falls in love with his OS and alienates everyone around him.
  Instead the script manages to drive home a real point about people feeling fundamentally disconnected to the natural world and society. Jonze ensures that no characters, with the exception of his ex-wife, belittle Joaquin Pheonix’s character (Theodore) for dating an OS. Having so many people willingly accept the concept of dating an OS means that this feeling of atomisation permeates society and is not restricted to one character in particular. It encourages us to reflect about how the immersion of technology in our lives may be affecting our relationship with society. The script doesn’t beat you around the head with these little details either. Theodore’s job is to craft personal letters on behalf of customers. A weaker script would have drawn specific attention to this detail, possibly having a character monologuing about how detached everyone is. This script assumes you are smart enough to work these things out for yourself.</p>

  <p>Jonze also strengthened the premise and execution by creating such realistic characters and by giving Samantha (the OS) a personality of her own, so we don’t feel dismissive towards Theodore and their relationship. A weaker script would have emphasised the difference between the technology and the people. In the age of Siri and Kortana, Spike Jonze manages to highlight just how humane technology is becoming. Giving Samantha a human like personality also provided an extra dimension to interpreting the film.
  Some scenes were not only a means of investigating the influence of technology within our lives, but also were a way of understanding the difficulties within our own romantic relationships. There is a sequence in which Samantha tries to be intimate with Theodore in a way that feels uncomfortable, which not only highlights the difficulties involved with humans and machines getting intimate, but also highlights the struggles couples have in appealing to each others sexual preferences. It’s strange to think that this relationship, a man and his OS, is perhaps the most accurate and is the most emotionally real depiction of a relationship put to screen.</p>

  <p>All of this may not have succeeded were it not for Spike Jonze’s direction too. There is such a meticulous attention to detail, that it is impossible not to become immersed in this world. In terms of establishing the world, there is a consistent style of fashion and consistent colour scheme throughout the movie, which helps anchor you within this future society. Without the fashion or colour choices, there is nothing to distinguish the time periods appropriately. At the same time, these choices in fashion are not so distinct that you feel alienated from the world that is created. This process extends to the soundtrack too. By using Arcade Fire, Jonze prompts something of an ethereal sound, but still grounds it in a world we are familiar to.
  Grounding the soundtrack allows us to open up to the world established within the movie more. Many science-fictions attempt to sound as futuristic as possible, including Blade Runner. I adore the Blade Runner soundtrack, but it wouldn’t have worked in a film like this. In order to embrace the relationship and accept the similarities between the characters, we need to embrace and accept the similarities between our world and the one established in <em>Her</em>.</p>

  <p>Jonze’s direction also pays attention to detail when establishing the themes of the film. In public shots, there are lots of people engaging in technology in different ways and very few people engaging with each other. Pleasantly though, it doesn’t go overboard and have everyone ignoring each other and everyone staring into mobile devices, because this movie assumes you are smart enough by giving you enough information to understand these details for yourself. It does what is required of it to cement the point.
  The cinematography in this film goes a long way towards underpinning the thematic purpose of the movie too. A lot of low angle close up shots are used of Theodore. While this in itself is not inventive cinematography, it encourages you to invest in the relationship further. You could interpret a lot of shots as being from the desired physical perspective of Samantha, as you are close to Theodore and at the traditional height of a female in a heterosexual relationship. By contrast, shots between Theodore and Catherine (Theodore’s ex-wife) often separate the characters by using over-the-shoulder shots, thus showing their emotional difference. Sometimes the most simple filming techniques are often the most effective.</p>

  <p>Of course, I have to mention the cast of this movie, specifically Joaquin Pheonix and Scarlett Johansson. This movie could not have succeeded without these two and both performers had to face different challenges when making this film. Johansson had the difficulty of being completely restricted to using her own voice, yet is so captivating as Samantha. She manages to capture that ‘corporate’ sound that OSs have, yet provides a much more emotional performance. Her voice throughout the movie captures the development of Samantha’s character, right from her installation by speaking with such enthusiasm before becoming more reserved by the end of the film.
  Pheonix had the opposite burden by rarely having the camera off his face. It put a lot more pressure on him to convey a wider range of emotions throughout the film. He manages to do so however by having such wonderfully expressive eyes. To this day there are a lot of actors who convey emotion when delivering dialogue, but then wait for their next line. Pheonix manages to capture the thoughts and feelings of Theodore without needing to utter a single word.</p>

  <p>I could quite frankly talk about this movie forever and there is so much more to discuss, but I feel I would be spoiling the entire movie if I continued any further. Perhaps some day I may write more about this film and break down every small aspect in order to convey just how wonderful this movie really is. I have barely scratched the surface of just what a beautiful and powerful movie this is, but talking about it more will just give you less reason to see the movie for yourself. There are no films out now that have better characterisation, direction or scripting. There are far less that have as strong an emotional core and themes that will resonate with you for the rest of your life. Fully recommended.</p>
