  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGdiACWiMAM" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">Choose Nostalgia...</a></h2>
<div class="Body">

  <p>There are so many sequences in which we the characters being abandoned and alienated by modernity. Begbie is the prime example, as he sees his son try to get a legitimate qualification in 'Hotel Management'. Spud's talent for forging signatures appears to be  redundant in a society that values online bank transfers. Sick Boy laments how the great wave of gentrification has not yet reached his part of Edinburgh. Sick Boy and Renton both go to a Protestant pub that commemorates the Battle of the Boyne. Nostalgia becomes a means of lamenting modern society, even if it's a dangerous feeling. Begbie wants revenge, Sick Boy wants more money to feed his cocaine habit and the Protestants want to attack Catholics.</p>

  <p>When I refer to the violent tonal shifts that undermine the movie, in particular I'm referring to a subplot where Begbie struggles to make love to his wife. I understand the intention to display what a pathetic man he is, but the big pay off is that he takes Viagra and gets an erection after chasing Renton. All the tension from Renton's narrow escape from death is evaporated as his chaser is essentially a figure of fun. Begbie's threat disappears. As an audience, we didn't need that because there are many sequences where Begbie is pathetic, perhaps the most important example is when it's revealed his dad was a 'wino'. I wanted to empathise with Begbie, not mock him. It ultimately undermines the point of the film. We're supposed to feel pity for these people that look backwards instead of forwards, but by mocking them, we dismiss all of their concerns.</p>

  <p>When I referred to lack of consequence from the previous film, I mean that there isn't enough of Renton thinking about or lamenting the death of Tommy (Kevin McKidd), or his relationship with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) or Sick Boy thinking about his dead child. There is one sequence on the moors where they briefly mention the deaths of these characters and there is one shot of Renton looking at Diane during his 'Choose Life' Monologue. I can understand if the sheer lack of consequences to the previous film are frustrating to audience members because it feels like a lack of character development. Personally though, I feel like the characters are deliberately choosing to have a selective memory otherwise it may taint their perception of the past.</p>
