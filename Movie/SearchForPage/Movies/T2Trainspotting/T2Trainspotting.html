  <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGdiACWiMAM" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">Choose Nostalgia...</a></h2>
<div class="Body">

  <p>There's always a worry when certain films announce sequels. Some films are resolved perfectly and are made in such perfect conditions you'd worry that a sequel wouldn't have the charm of the original. You'd expect such sequels would merely be a cash grab, with a plot overly reliant on nostalgia. This film is not as brilliant as the original, but it's a damn worthy sequel and oddly enough, it's the emphasis on nostalgia that makes it worthy.</p>

  <p>The focus on nostalgia is particularly salient in this current environment. The world has seen two serious political campaigns that focused on looking backwards. Brexit sought to 'Take back control' and Donald Drumpf vowed to 'Make Donald Drumpf Again'. As consumers we can turn on our television and see the return of old shows such as <em>Robot Wars </em>or <em>MacGuyver</em>, or we could go to the Cinema and see <em>Power Rangers</em>, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> or <em>Jumanji. </em>In an increasingly unstable world as progress marches on and leaves people behind, people look back to when things made sense to them. They look back to the films of their youth that made them feel good, like <em>Trainspotting</em>.</p>

  <p><em>Trainspotting</em> is the ultimate Britpop movie, a film that on its surface is whimsical or fantastical but there is a strong undercurrent of despair at the British lifestyle. Certainly at the screening I attended a significant proportion of the audience was there to relive the fantasy and the 'lust for life' they remember from <em>Trainspotting</em>. <em>Trainspotting </em>never had a 'lust for life', it was essentially a film about escapism. <em>T2 </em>plays with this nostalgia for it's predecessor while simultaneously making points about the dangers of looking backwards, about false memory and how nostalgia is ultimately another form of escapism life's struggles. This nostalgia manifests itself in it's characters, plot, direction and soundtrack.</p>

  <p>Each character's motivation and actions are ultimately symbolic of this. Renton (Ewan McGregor) wants to reunite with his old friends due to his struggles abroad, Begbie (Robert Carlyle) wants revenge on Renton after his life has gone wrong, Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) wants to revive his dying pub and Spud (Ewen Bremner) wants a reason to live having lost everything since the last film. All of the characters look backwards to find solutions to their present problems. Along the way we see that these characters feel left behind by the modern world and perceive the past with a certain positivity that is not necessarily reflective of the life they lived. Particular examples can be found in the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/Webpage/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/T2Trainspotting/T2TrainspottingSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a>.</p>

  <p>Quite frankly, the film is masterfully done in terms of reinforcing this point beyond the scripting and character motivations. Danny Boyle is easily one of the most talented directors these isles have ever produced. There are many sequels, such as <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens, </em>that copy shots from it's predecessors for no other reason than fear of straying away from a formula. Boyle deliberately recreates specific shots from <em>Trainspotting</em>, but as a means of conveying how a character's life has progressed, yet their mindset hasn't. The sequence where Renton is hit by a car is shot exactly the same way, but Renton is older, the car is different and the context is different. Beyond recreating shots though, Boyle heavily uses freeze frames again in order to reflect the selective memory of the characters as well as their desire for time to stay still for once.</p>

  <p>Beyond the cinematography and the editing, the soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. The brief glimpses of Underworld's <em>Born Slippy</em> are used to jog memories and the use of classics in an ironic fashion invoke the previous film. <em>Trainspotting</em> had Iggy Pop's <em>Lust for Life </em>playing underneath Renton's tirade against Life's pressures. <em>T2</em> has <em>Relax </em>by Frankie Goes to Hollywood as Renton faces a life threatening situation. However, it's the use of modern synthpop, that I'm particularly fascinated with. It's use is a particularly brilliant way of representing the juxtaposition between present and past, due to blending of modern and retro sounds. It's representative of the backwards facing culture that we are a part of, yet the progressive nature of it too.</p>

  <p>As much as I could continue to praise the film, by talking further about the direction, such as the use of mise-en-scene, the locations and the performances, there are fundamental flaws to this film. As a sequel, and one that emphasises nostalgia, it cannot stand alone as an individual movie. It's reliant on references to the previous film and would make little sense without it. It needs to be seen in conjunction with the first film, not on its own. Furthermore, as a sequel that borrows imagery from its predecessor, it doesn't have the same edge or subversiveness.</p>

  <p>On a thematic point, its central message may be difficult to relate to if you're not of a certain age. This film talks about how people have been abandoned by time and if you're in your youth, it becomes a difficult message to relate to as you've been shaped to suit the present. This is not to say if you're young don't bother with it, it may be something that you can come back to and appreciate, or you may be in a position to relate to it. Despite being in my early twenties, I grew up near a declining seaside town, so I feel I can relate to the notion of being abandoned by time. If you are part of the target audience for this film, its possible to feel insulted by the film at points too. There is a scene where Sick Boy says to Renton words to the extent of 'You're only here for nostalgia aren't you?', which can be interpreted as a not so subtle comment aimed at the audience. I don't have a problem with this, but can understand if others do.</p>

  <p>In terms of tone, there are many moments that I feel are underwhelming because there's a joke or some form of comedy attached. Genuine moments of menace and terror are thrown away because there is a joke. As a consequence when there are moments with no joke, you're still expecting to laugh instead of feel frightened or tense. There's one particular example with Begbie, which I talk about in the <span style="color:#000000;"><a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/T2Trainspotting/T2TrainspottingSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a></span>. Moreover, if you're looking for satisfactory resolutions from the previous film, you aren't likely to get them. For instance, there is one mention of the baby and nothing more. I can defend this to some extent by suggesting this is reflective of how nostalgia invokes selective memory, but its understandable if you feel unsatisfied by the lack of emotional hang over from the last film.</p>

  <p>T2, as I said at the start, is therefore a worthy sequel, but not as brilliant as the first film. It could never really hope to be as good really. There is a development of the original ideas of <em>Trainspotting</em>. When we're young we seek to escape responsibility through various means, be it films, drugs, music or violence. When we get old, we seek to escape our current responsibilities by looking back to our past. <em>T2 </em>carries a similar message to it's older sibling, it's shot in a familiarly dynamic way and exceeds most films in terms of editing, cinematography, performances and so on.
  The problem is, it cannot stand on its own two feet and critiquing nostalgia through the means of a sequel can be somewhat ironic. I'd still recommend this film though. If you haven't seen the first film, I implore you to do so because it is one of the finest films ever made. I'd encourage you to see this film too and if you struggle to relate, come back to it again in twenty years time.</p>
