  <p>Typically I’m not one to watch westerns, but it’s not hard to see why people like this film. This is what a Western should be really. A simple plot aided by an exciting execution. I remember watching the odd <em>Channel 5</em> western at my grandparents' at a young age and an accompanying sense of bewilderment. As a young child, it’s easy to get confused, but really I just didn’t know who the villains were; one minute they're killing off the lazily depicted Native Americans and the next they’re facing each other in an abandoned town centre, with Colt 45s at the ready. It was hard to sympathise with anyone due to the senseless slaughter. This is not a problem with this film at all: Clint Eastwood visits a rough neighbourhood and clears it up. It’s a framework we’re well used to now in non-western films such as <em>Harry Brown </em><em>and </em>Eastwood's own<em> Dirty Harry series</em>.</p>

  <p>With such a simple framework, it then becomes about the execution and this is certainly executed with a lot of style. The performances are pretty solid throughout, quite impressive for a cast of people who don’t speak English as a first language. Eastwood is rather fascinating in this film, you don’t quite feel that he’s 'acting' the part, it’s just his innate intensity and charisma that helps this film achieve its high standard. This is by no means a criticism; it’s just an example of splendid casting. You have your actors who play the part and others who just are the part. Eastwood is definitely the part.</p>

  <p>The action sequences are well done and quite intense too. The low angle shots of Eastwood firing his gun added a unique character to this film. It's certainly more interesting compared to the traditional methods of filming someone shooting. It emphasises the dominance of Eastwood's character as well as highlighting the skill involved in firing so rapidly. The wide angles allow you to see what happened in each action shot (oh how I long them in the modern blockbuster). Furthermore, the violence made sense in the context of the story; it’s not just an action scene shoehorned in to give a character something to do or to prevent the audience from being bored.</p>

  <p>Special mention has to go to the soundtrack as well. Ennio Morricone is quite frankly brilliant and this film showcases his mastery of composition and his understanding of when to use a soundtrack and when not to. I would suggest that a criticism is that he essentially uses two songs and the soundtrack gets a bit repetitive but let’s be reasonable, the budget for this film was tiny (most of it going to Clint Eastwood) and these songs are fantastic.</p>

  <p>A more legitimate criticism however is that perhaps the story just isn’t original enough. It is my understanding that the plot is essentially borrowed from a Kurosawa film. It’s adapted and usually I’m ok with that if it’s making a point about similarity, but I don’t feel like this is a commentary more of a framework for the director to hang his Stetson on. It can also be quite difficult to get into some sequences because of the dubbing. Generally, it’s executed quite well and dubbing is generally easier for lower budget films, but the sequences with Marisol's son are horribly distracting. Perhaps they could’ve been directed better, maybe not have the child say anything at all or maybe not dubbing the child.</p>

  <p>These things are symptomatic of a low-budget film though and it’s a bit unfair to criticise a film due to its practical limitations. It’s an enjoyable film overall and is pretty much the 'go to' example of how to execute a western. When a man's got money in his pocket and this film is available, I recommend you hand it over!</p>
