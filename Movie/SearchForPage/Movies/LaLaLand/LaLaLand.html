<p>Alright, that title is a but unfair and has more negative connotations than I intend to convey, but welcome to the era of clickbait journalism. Right off the bat though, I will say that this film is enjoyable and is well made, but discussions about awards seem somewhat undeserved. I'm not going to discount the possibility that I may be more critical of this film in partial reaction to the media attention <em>La La Land</em> has received, yet I feel that if it was as strong a movie as we've been lead to believe I wouldn't be reacting in such a way. I know my viewing pleasure of <em>Mad Max: Fury Road </em>and <em>Her </em>wasn't in anyway damaged by the rave reviews they received. Still, let's dive in.</p>

<p>On the positive front, I have to say there is some outstanding direction by Damien Chazelle! It must be intimidating to be only thirty two years of age, only having directed two previous feature films and yet telling actors such as J.K. Simmons, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling how to do their jobs as well as the entire production crew. Furthermore, it's hard enough to produce a film with such visual flair and to get top range performances from your actors without having to throw choreography in there! Truly, he is one of the brightest talents in direction at this present moment. There are a few sequences that shouldn't work, yet seem to purely because of his direction.</p>

<p>The tone, for example, is rather fascinating. It wants to balance a 1950's jovial and aspirational musical, like <em>Singing in the Rain </em>with a more serious and tense film like <em>Whiplash</em>. At times, it oddly works. Towards the start of the film, Ryan Gosling's character (Sebastian) is playing Christmas songs in a bar before going off script and playing some jazz. He is fired for this. It's somewhat refreshing to have this vein of realism within this kind of film, primarily because Hollywood will often tell an audience that anything is possible and everything will be fine. <em>La La Land</em> accepts that failures are inevitable, especially when you're aspiring to work in the entertainment industry. Furthermore, this film will show one of the few things that aspiring entertainers rarely ever seen in film, that compromise is a necessity. Sebastian's idealism has to take a back seat while he has bills to pay.</p>

<p>The performances by the two leads are relatively solid too considering the circumstances. From an acting perspective they are more than capable, they're both particularly effective in terms of their facial reactions. Emma Stone has such wonderfully expressive eyes and Ryan Gosling has that mixture of a warm smile and kind eyes. When given their individual moments they can shine. They are somewhat limited though when they are expected to perform beyond the acting. Ryan Gosling is a okish singer, nothing excellent, while Emma Stone can sing pretty well.
As dancers though, there are quite a few shaky moments. Stone's frame stumps at different points and Gosling looks at his feet once or twice. You can tell these two are actors who dance instead of completely accomplished entertainers. The positive way to view this is that the film feels more 'authentic' as the characters are not dancers or singers by trade. The negative is that it can feel incredibly distracting once you notice these details.</p>

<p>The music is acceptable. I enjoyed it in the moment. Still, I kind of feel that a large proportion of the soundtrack is forgettable. Typically a musical has at least two or three songs that really stick in your mind after one viewing. Having seen <em>Blood Brothers</em> once, I can still remember a significant proportion of the lyrics to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzhdRTUGCHE">'Marilyn Monroe'</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0Ba_xCg96E">'Tell Me It's Not True'</a></em>, but when it comes to<em> La La Land</em>, the only phrases that stick in my mind are 'City of Stars, are you shining just for me?' and 'Here's to the ones who dream'.
It simply isn't memorable enough. Furthermore, for a film that essentially claims to be about jazz, it strikes me as problematic that I can imagine with more clarity Conan O'Brien singing the songs than I can Louis Armstrong. I will go further into the problems with the 'jazz nature of the film' a bit later on.</p>

<p>In fairness, the soundtrack isn't necessarily helped by the film's pacing. Towards the start of the film there are quite a few musical numbers close together and towards the end there are long stretches without music. Personally I found it distracting, as the start of the film limits characterisation purely to put musical numbers in the film. It felt like the dance numbers were superficial fun in that sense when I wanted to feel more engaged with the characters. Furthermore by having 'dramatic scene, song and dance number, scene, song' instead of a series of scenes, as a viewer I felt like I was being thrown into emotions instead of being guided along.
The ending has the reverse problem of having so many scenes without much musical interlude that when a musical number eventually appears, that it becomes distracting. Additionally, clustering most of the musical numbers towards the start of the film makes it harder to differentiate different songs from each other as they all relate to a similar event instead of being about completely separate events. By contrast, one reason <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> is an effective musical is because each song clearly distinguishes different parts of the story.</p>

<p>If I'm getting to the real crux of the matter as to why I may not have enjoyed the music or the story as much as others may have is largely because of the characterisation and the self congratulatory streak within the writing. I am closer to Sam Lowry (the protagonist from <em>Brazil</em>) than I ever will be to Sebastian. My ambitions are simple and smaller scale, as I have very little desire for fame and fortune. <em>La La Land</em> is very much a film focused towards aspiring entertainers and is very much focused on the characters becoming famous and how much of a struggle it can be.
To me, it feels incredibly 'bourgeois' of the characters to talk about how hard it is to try and become famous when they're living relatively comfortable lifestyles. Neither truly struggle with any poverty, disability, prejudice or any systematic disadvantages, yet they are the put upon characters. A central conflict is whether or not Sebastian should play music he doesn't enjoy in order earn enough money to pursue his ambitions. Most people in life do not have the privilege to turn down high paying work because it may conflict with their artistic integrity.</p>

<p>There are who sequences where both of the lead characters come across as pompous and privileged, Sebastian being the main culprit. Other than the agony he feels playing popular music, he spends a large proportion of time lecturing characters about what jazz is and how he will save it. White middle class man is going to save the historically poor black man's music. Without a hint of irony, in one scene he argues with John Legend's character about how he understands jazz better than John Legend ever will.
I will happily admit I'm not a jazz expert, but to me jazz is a form of music that constantly fluctuates and is important to black history. Yet, Ryan Gosling's character wants to keep it within certain musical boundaries, preventing the art form's evolution and he will tell the black musician that he is ruining the genre. Does that not strike you, dear reader, as a being a bit uncomfortable? It doesn't help that the writer and director of this film is a white male who seems intent on restoring jazz. Should've just called Sebastian 'Mary Sue' and just be done with it.</p>

<p>As for Mia, I'm not quite sure what her character is supposed to be. She seems to just be an idealistic aspiring actress. If pressed to use the 'Plinkett character test', I would struggle to describe Mia in much depth. We're just expected to empathise with her because of her Hollywood ambition. Her primary struggles are about the lack of attention she gets and how little she enjoys Hollywood parties. You'd get the impression that L.A. is a wretched hive of scum and villainy were it not for the fact she spends a lot of time in locations where she'll lecture you or other characters will lecture you on how great L.A. is.
In a traffic jam the drivers dance and sing about how sunny it is in winter, in the studio lot Mia will enthuse about the iconic locations and on the hill side she'll fawn over the scenery. It really makes you forget the vapid and shallow underbelly she's supposedly struggling against. I will have to refrain from writing about the characters further for fear of revealing the plot. My further frustrations can be found in the <a href="/Users/jwbeast/Documents/J-W-Barnett.github.io/Movie/SearchForPage/Movies/LaLaLand/LaLaLandSpoilers.html">spoiler section</a>.</p>

<p>I feel like I've been overly critical of <em>La La Land</em> in this review, but I feel I must counteract the uncritical praise this movie is getting. Let's be clear, there is nothing inherently wrong with criticism, it's a means of expressing how I feel this movie could have been improved or why this particular motion picture didn't connect with me as much as it did with others. There are quite clearly sections of the media that love this film because of the scarcity of musical cinema and because of their fondness for LA. Equally there are other sections of the media that hate this movie for the same reasons. I enjoy musicals, I just happen to think that this isn't a stand out musical.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I recommend this film, for it is a good film. I just feel it's not deserving of any 'Best Picture' awards in my eyes. It's a capable and enjoyable musical, but it lacks sufficient depth and gravitas to be considered a truly remarkable piece of cinema. Musicals like <em>Les Miserables </em>or <em>Chicago</em> were and still are (if you see their stage play equivalents) more effective and deeper films. Their songs are memorable, you only need to see these films once to remember several songs, and there are multiple themes within. <em>La La Land </em>has a simple story and the songs are somewhat forgettable, meaning it lacks that real staying power that I expected of it. It is, however, enjoyable to see musicals back on the big screen and the pleasant aspects outweigh the frustrating ones. In essence, the film can carry on dreaming, but it does look like it may oversleep.</p>
