  <p>I honestly have no idea why these two characters got together in the film. As characters, I've already said there isn't much I can say in terms of describing their personalities. There is about as much chemistry between these characters as you would find when mixing still and sparkling water. As for the way in which they got together, it makes even less sense. They both trade insults at each other at a party, then dance together claiming they aren't attracted to one another, then Sebastian stalks Mia at work so they can lecture each other about acting and jazz before going on a film date. When I think about love, I also think insults, declaration of hatred, stalking and lecturing. It's like Byron wrote the script himself. Admittedly though, I will give them though is that they share the same ambitions towards fame and fortune but to me it undermines the relationship because the relationship becomes about how each partner can use each other to further their career.</p>

  <p> The ending was the worst part of the relationship though. It drove me nuts. We have a film supposedly based on a romance between these two characters and how they must separate to follow their dreams leaving them both happy. In and of itself this not a problem. What is a problem is that neither character truly appears happy at the end of the film, yet the tone is so weirdly vibrant that as an audience we're supposed to accept that the film ended in an optimistic manner. Mia initially appears shocked and upset as Sebastian plays the song from when they first met and they both envision a version of the past where they both stayed together and their dreams were realised together. They both then smile at each other as she leaves with her husband as if to imply that they have both moved on.</p>

  <p> A large problem with the ending is that we have no idea what Mia's husband is like. We know nothing about him other than he exists and he had a child with Mia. The relationship therefore feels superficial and when Mia smiles to Sebastian at the end in a manner which implies there are no hard feelings between the characters, it doesn't feel genuine. It feels like Mia has abandoned true emotional happiness for materialistic purposes and she only just realises it. She has her fame, she has her fortune and she has her trophy husband, yet she could've had that with Sebastian. Her success and the character arc she goes through is completely devalued as a consequence. If Damien Chazelle was ending for the more downbeat ending, this could also have worked, but when the credits role a bright 'the end' appears on screen and the credits roll with rather lively music. Much like the start of the film, I felt like I was being forced into different emotions instead of being guided to them.</p>
